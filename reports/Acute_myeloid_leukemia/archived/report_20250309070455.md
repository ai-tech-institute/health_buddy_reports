# Understanding Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

This summary provides the latest information on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) to help patients and their loved ones navigate diagnosis, treatment, and support. Always discuss your specific situation with your healthcare team.

## 1. New Treatment Options

*   **Treosulfan (Grafapexâ„¢): FDA-approved** in January 2025, Treosulfan is used with fludarabine as preparation for stem cell transplants in adults and children (1 year+) with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It may offer improved event-free survival with potentially fewer side effects compared to some other chemotherapy regimens, particularly for older individuals eligible for stem cell transplants.
    *   **Important:** Common chemotherapy side effects can include nausea, fatigue, hair loss, and increased risk of infection. Common side effects specific to Treosulfan can include myelosuppression (leading to low blood counts), mucositis (inflammation of the mouth and gut), and potential liver enzyme elevations. Discuss potential risks like mucositis with your doctor. Treosulfan is often compared to alternatives like busulfan/cyclophosphamide. Ask your doctor if it offers fewer *specific* side effects compared to other options. Check with your treatment center about its availability and potential insurance coverage issues.
*   **Revumenib: FDA-approved** in November 2024, this oral medication targets adults with KMT2A-rearranged relapsed/refractory AML. Clinical trials showed promising response rates.
    *   **Important:** Side effects to discuss with your doctor include differentiation syndrome and QT prolongation. Differentiation syndrome is a potentially serious side effect where leukemia cells mature too rapidly and release substances into the blood. Symptoms can include fever, difficulty breathing, weight gain, and swelling. Report any new symptoms to your doctor immediately, as it can be managed if caught early. QT prolongation affects your heart rhythm and requires monitoring with ECGs (electrocardiograms). Common side effects specific to Revumenib can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and edema.
*   **Quizartinib (Vanflyta): FDA-approved** in July 2023, Quizartinib is an oral targeted therapy for adults newly diagnosed with AML who have a FLT3-ITD mutation.
    *   **Important:** Common side effects include fatigue, nausea, and cardiac issues like QT prolongation. QT prolongation affects your heart rhythm and requires monitoring with ECGs (electrocardiograms). Common side effects specific to Quizartinib can include diarrhea, stomatitis (mouth sores), and rash. Ask your doctor if any specific tests are needed to confirm your suitability for Quizartinib beyond standard genetic testing.
*   **AUTX-703:** The FDA granted fast track designation to AUTX-703 in February 2025. This novel oral drug targets and breaks down KAT2A/B proteins important in AML and is being studied in *early stage* Phase 1 clinical trials for relapsed/refractory AML (trials starting early 2025). Fast track designation *speeds up review* but doesn't guarantee approval.
    *   **Looking for Clinical Trials?:**  Search clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) for "AUTX-703 AML" and filter by "recruiting" status to find eligibility criteria and trial locations. If you find a clinical trial on clinicaltrials.gov that seems relevant to you, **discuss it with your doctor to see if it might be a suitable option and to understand the eligibility criteria and trial details in depth.**
*   **Combination Therapies:** Research suggests that combinations of venetoclax (an MCL-1 inhibitor) with dasatinib or bosutinib (SRC family kinase inhibitors) are being studied in clinical trials to effectively kill AML cells.
    *   **Important:** Ask your doctor these questions: "Are there any clinical trials combining MCL-1 inhibitors and SRC kinase inhibitors available at your center or nearby? What are the potential benefits and risks of these combinations compared to standard treatments in my specific AML subtype?"

## 2. Understanding Your Prognosis and Risk Factors

The average five-year survival rate for AML is around 30%, but this is an *average*. Prognosis varies significantly based on age, AML subtype, genetic mutations, overall health, and response to treatment. Significant progress is being made, and survival rates are improving, especially with newer targeted therapies and stem cell transplantation.

*   **PSPC1 Protein:** Researchers are *investigating* new drugs that can block the activity of PSPC1 protein in *laboratory studies*. By blocking PSPC1, these potential treatments aim to help AML cells mature into normal blood cells and stop cancer growth.
*   **Risk Stratification:** Discuss your individual risk stratification with your hematologist/oncologist. Doctors use systems like the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) to categorize AML into favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk groups based on genetic and chromosomal factors. This helps predict prognosis and guide treatment intensity.
*   **Measurable Residual Disease (MRD):** Detecting MRD can indicate a higher risk of relapse. MRD is often measured using highly sensitive tests like flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on bone marrow samples. Knowing MRD status after initial treatment helps doctors decide if further treatment, such as consolidation chemotherapy or stem cell transplant, is needed to improve long-term remission.
*   **Genetic Mutations:** Genetic testing is crucial at diagnosis and potentially at relapse. Knowing the specific mutations helps doctors choose the most effective targeted therapies. For example, patients with FLT3 mutations may benefit from FLT3 inhibitors like quizartinib or midostaurin. Conversely, knowing favorable mutations like NPM1 or CEBPA helps tailor treatment intensity.
*   **Secondary AML (sAML):** Secondary AML (sAML) refers to AML that develops after prior cancer treatment (therapy-related AML) or evolves from a pre-existing blood disorder like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It is important to understand the specific type of AML for treatment planning.

## 3. Recognizing Symptoms and Getting Diagnosed

*   **Early Symptoms:** Early AML symptoms are often nonspecific and can resemble the flu (fever, fatigue, etc.). Other symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite, headaches, shortness of breath, frequent infections, unusual bleeding/bruising, bone/joint pain, swollen lymph nodes, and paleness. Experiencing *multiple* of these symptoms together, especially if they are persistent or worsening, warrants medical attention. Early detection is important for better treatment outcomes in AML.
*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis involves blood tests (complete blood count and peripheral blood smear) and bone marrow examination (aspiration and biopsy). Molecular testing and immunophenotyping are used to identify specific AML subtypes and guide treatment. AML is diagnosed when the bone marrow contains 20% or more *blast cells* (immature blood cells). Timely diagnosis is crucial.

## 4. The Role of Your Immune System

Research suggests that certain immune cells called T cells can recognize and attack AML cells. Researchers are also exploring different types of immunotherapy, such as CAR T-cell therapy (where immune cells are modified to target leukemia cells) and checkpoint inhibitors (which help the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer). These therapies are being explored to enhance the body's own anti-leukemia immune response, particularly in relapsed AML.

## 5. Emerging Treatment Strategies

*   **Menin Inhibitors:** Show promise in KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemia, NPM1-mutated AML, and AML with the HOX-A9/MEIS signature. Menin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that work by blocking the activity of a protein called Menin. Menin is important for the growth of leukemia cells in certain types of AML, particularly those with KMT2A rearrangements and NPM1 mutations. By blocking Menin, these drugs can help to stop leukemia cells from growing.
*   **CD123-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs):** Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a type of targeted therapy that combines an antibody that specifically targets cancer cells (in this case, CD123 on AML cells) with a chemotherapy drug. This allows for more targeted delivery of chemotherapy to cancer cells, potentially reducing side effects.

## 6. Understanding Your Blood Work and Reports

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** A CBC is often the first test done when leukemia is suspected. It can show abnormalities in white blood cell counts, red blood cell counts (anemia), and platelet counts, which can be indicators of AML.
*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** A bone marrow biopsy is essential to diagnose AML. It confirms the presence of leukemia cells and helps determine the percentage of blast cells, which is part of the diagnostic criteria.
*   **Chromosomal Studies (Cytogenetics):** Cytogenetic testing helps identify specific chromosomal changes in AML cells. These changes are important for classifying the AML subtype, determining prognosis, and guiding treatment choices, including whether stem cell transplant is recommended.
*   **Immunophenotyping:** Immunophenotyping helps identify the specific subtype of AML by looking at proteins on the surface of the leukemia cells. This is important for refining diagnosis and treatment strategies.
*   **Molecular Testing:** Molecular testing looks for specific gene mutations in AML cells. Identifying these mutations helps personalize treatment, as certain mutations may respond to targeted therapies or impact prognosis.
