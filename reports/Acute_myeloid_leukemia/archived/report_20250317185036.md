# Understanding Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

This information helps you and your family understand AML, recent treatment advances, and how to navigate your care. Remember, the symptoms described below are not exclusive to AML and could be related to other conditions. If you experience these, consult a doctor for diagnosis rather than self-diagnosing.

**What is AML?**

AML is a fast-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The bone marrow produces abnormal, immature white blood cells (myeloblasts) that crowd out normal blood cells. This leads to fewer healthy red blood cells (anemia, fatigue), platelets (bleeding, bruising), and normal white blood cells (increased infection risk).

**Common Symptoms:** Fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising or bleeding, frequent infections, fever. AML may be found during routine blood tests before symptoms appear.

**How is AML Diagnosed?**

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures blood cell numbers and types. Abnormal results suggest leukemia but require further tests. *Results typically available within a day.*
*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** Confirms AML diagnosis and determines the AML type, crucial for treatment planning. *Results may take several days to a week.*
*   **Chromosomal Studies (Cytogenetics):** Identifies genetic changes in leukemia cells, categorizing AML into risk groups (favorable, intermediate, adverse) for tailored treatment. *Results may take 1-2 weeks.*
*   **Immunophenotyping:** Classifies AML by identifying proteins on leukemia cell surfaces. This detailed classification is important for prognosis and guides targeted therapy selection. *Results may take 1-2 weeks.*

**Why is Knowing the AML Subtype Important?**

Different subtypes respond differently to treatment. Subtype knowledge helps doctors choose the best plan. Major subtypes include AML with mutated NPM1, AML with t(15;17), and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes.

**What is Measurable Residual Disease (MRD)?**

MRD tests detect remaining leukemia cells after treatment. Achieving MRD negativity (no detectable leukemia) is a major goal linked to better outcomes. MRD is measured using flow cytometry, PCR, or next-generation sequencing (NGS).

# Treatment Options for AML

*   **Chemotherapy:** The foundation of AML treatment, aiming to kill leukemia cells and induce remission. Different chemotherapy combinations and intensities are used depending on the AML subtype, patient's age, and overall health. Typical phases include induction (initial intensive treatment) and consolidation (to maintain remission).

*   **Targeted Therapy:** These drugs target specific mutations or proteins in AML cells. Genetic testing (e.g., FLT3, IDH1/2 mutation testing) is crucial to determine eligibility for these therapies.

    *   **FLT3 Inhibitors:** For AML with FLT3 mutations (FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD).
        *   *Midostaurin (oral capsules):* Approved for *newly diagnosed* AML with FLT3 mutation, *in combination with* standard chemotherapy. Common side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue. Serious but manageable side effects: low blood counts (cytopenias) requiring monitoring and supportive care.
        *   *Gilteritinib & Quizartinib (oral tablets):* Approved for *adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML* with FLT3 mutation. Gilteritinib's side effects can include QT prolongation. Differentiation syndrome is a potentially serious but manageable side effect caused by rapid maturation of leukemia cells.
    *   **IDH Inhibitors:** For AML with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations.
        *   *Ivosidenib (oral tablets, IDH1 inhibitor) & Enasidenib (oral tablets, IDH2 inhibitor):* Approved for *relapsed or refractory AML*. Also used in the *frontline setting for patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy*. Common side effects: nausea, fatigue. Serious but manageable side effects: differentiation syndrome, low blood counts.
    *   **BCL-2 Inhibitors (Venetoclax):**
        *   *Venetoclax (oral tablets):* Typically used with low-intensity chemotherapy like azacitidine or low-dose cytarabine. Beneficial for *older adults with newly diagnosed AML or those unfit for intensive chemotherapy*. Common side effects: low blood counts (myelosuppression), infections. Serious but manageable side effects: tumor lysis syndrome (preventable with monitoring, hydration, and uric acid-reducing medications).

*   **Stem Cell Transplant:** The only curative option for AML.

    *   *Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant (from a donor):*
        *   Finding a Donor: If an allogeneic transplant is recommended, the first step is to find a suitable donor, either a matched relative or an unrelated donor through registries.
        *   Conditioning Therapy: Before the transplant, you will receive high-dose chemotherapy (conditioning) to destroy your bone marrow and leukemia cells.
        *   Transplant Infusion: Healthy stem cells from the donor are infused into your bloodstream, similar to a blood transfusion.
        *   Post-Transplant Care: After the transplant, you will be closely monitored for engraftment (when the new stem cells start producing blood cells) and for complications like GVHD. This phase requires close medical supervision and supportive care.
        *   After chemotherapy, healthy stem cells from a donor replace your damaged bone marrow. Stem cells can come from a matched related donor (sibling), a matched unrelated donor (from a registry), or a haploidentical donor (partially matched family member).
        *   Conditioning regimens (myeloablative or reduced intensity) are used before transplant.
        *   Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a potential complication where the donor cells attack the patient's healthy cells.
        *   Transplant is often considered for patients in remission after initial chemotherapy, especially those with intermediate or high-risk disease.

*   **CAR-T Cell Therapy:** Still under investigation for AML and not yet a standard treatment. Being studied for relapsed/refractory AML.

*   **Newer Agents:**
    *   *Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (intravenous):* An antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD33, often expressed on AML cells. Used for *certain AML types, including some newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory cases, in adults and children with CD33-positive AML*. Common side effects include low blood counts. Serious but manageable side effects: veno-occlusive disease (VOD).
    *   Menin inhibitors and CD123 antibody-drug conjugates are being studied in clinical trials.

# Factors Affecting Prognosis

Several factors influence the outlook for AML:

*   **AML Subtype:** Some subtypes are more aggressive.
*   **Genetic Mutations:**
    *   Favorable: NPM1 mutation (without FLT3-ITD), biallelic CEBPA mutations.
    *   Intermediate Risk: Examples include DNMT3A mutations (in the absence of NPM1 or FLT3-ITD).
    *   Unfavorable: FLT3-ITD, TP53 mutations, complex karyotype.
    *   AML risk stratification evolves with research and new genetic markers.
*   **Age:** Younger adults generally have a better prognosis.
*   **White Blood Cell Count:** Higher counts can sometimes indicate a less favorable outlook.
*   **Response to Treatment:** Achieving complete remission quickly is a good sign.
*   **Cytogenetic Risk Groups:** Favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk groups based on chromosomal studies.
*   **Performance Status:** A patient's overall health and functional status at diagnosis is a significant prognostic indicator. Patients who are fitter and more active tend to tolerate treatment better and may have better outcomes.

# Support Resources

# Important Considerations

*   **Get a Second Opinion:** Consider getting an opinion from an AML specialist.
*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Ask questions and participate in treatment decisions with your healthcare team.
*   **Clinical Trials:** Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you. Clinicaltrials.gov and the LLS Clinical Trial Support Center are resources for finding trials. Participating in a clinical trial not only gives you access to cutting-edge treatments that are not yet widely available, but also contributes to advancing medical knowledge and improving care for future AML patients. Discuss clinical trial options with your doctor at every stage of your AML journey, as trials are not just for relapsed/refractory disease but also for frontline treatment.
*   **Individualized Treatment:** Treatment is based on your specific AML subtype, genetic changes, and other factors. Actively participate in discussions about your treatment plan and ask questions to understand *why* a particular approach is recommended for you.
