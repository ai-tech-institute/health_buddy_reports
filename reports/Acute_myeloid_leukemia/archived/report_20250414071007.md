            # Understanding AML: A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow where the bone marrow produces abnormal, immature white blood cells (myeloid blasts) that crowd out healthy blood cells. This guide provides updated information about AML, focusing on treatments, managing side effects, and finding support. Remember to discuss your specific case with your healthcare team.

## 1. New AML Treatment Options

AML treatment is rapidly evolving. Here's a look at some key therapies.

**What to Ask Your Doctor:** "Am I eligible for any of these new targeted therapies? What are the pros and cons of each option in my specific situation? Is a clinical trial an option for me?"

*   **Targeted Therapies:** These drugs target specific genetic changes in AML cells.
    *   **VYXEOS (liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine) (FDA-approved):** For newly diagnosed AML that arose after prior cancer treatment or with myelodysplasia-related changes (changes from a pre-leukemia condition). Typical context of use: often first line. Common side effects include fever, mouth sores, rash, edema, diarrhea, constipation, muscle pain, fatigue, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, headache, cough, decreased appetite, arrhythmia, pneumonia, bacteremia, and chills. Administered intravenously.
    *   **RYDAPT (midostaurin) (FDA-approved):** For AML patients with a FLT3-ITD mutation (a specific type of FLT3 mutation). Typical context of use: often first line in combination with chemotherapy. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, musculoskeletal pain, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and rash. Administered orally.
    *   **ONUREG (azacitidine) (FDA-approved):** For continued treatment (maintenance) of AML after remission following intensive chemotherapy. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, constipation, pneumonia, abdominal pain, joint pain, decreased appetite, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Administered orally.
    *   **DAURISMO (glasdegib) (FDA-approved):** With low-dose cytarabine for older adults (75+) or those who can't tolerate intensive chemotherapy. Inhibits the hedgehog pathway. Common side effects include fatigue, anemia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, edema, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, mouth sores, cough, and constipation. Administered orally.
    *   **TIBSOVO (ivosidenib) (FDA-approved):** Treats AML with an IDH1 mutation. Common side effects include differentiation syndrome, leukocytosis, nausea, joint pain, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, mouth sores, shortness of breath, rash, increased white blood cell count, and electrocardiogram QT prolongation. Administered orally.
    *   **VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) (FDA-approved):** Often with azacitidine or decitabine for newly diagnosed AML in adults 75+ or with health conditions preventing intensive chemotherapy. Targets the BCL-2 protein, helping leukemia cells die. Common side effects include low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), infections, and nausea. Administered orally.

*   **Drugs in Development:** These are being studied in clinical trials and not yet approved. Access is ONLY through participation in a clinical trial. Participating in a clinical trial is often the only way to access these promising new treatments currently under investigation.
    *   **Ziftomenib:** Currently in Phase II clinical trials for relapsed/refractory AML patients with NPM1 mutations. Preliminary results are promising, but more research is needed. Ziftomenib is not currently available outside of clinical trials.
    *   **Iomab-B:** An investigational targeted radiotherapy used as a conditioning regimen *prior to* bone marrow transplant (BMT) for patients with relapsed or refractory AML. It works by targeting and destroying cancer cells to prepare the body for a safer and more effective transplant. It is not a standalone AML treatment.
    *   **BST-236 (Aspacytarabine):** In Phase II development, designed to deliver high doses of cytarabine while reducing systemic exposure, potentially lessening side effects.
    *   **ICT01:** The FDA granted Fast Track Designation to ICT01 in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax for AML patients aged 75 or older, or those unable to tolerate standard chemotherapy. FDA Fast Track Designation is intended to speed up the review process for promising drugs treating serious conditions. While it can potentially lead to patients accessing new treatments sooner *if* the drug is ultimately approved, it's important to remember that Fast Track designation does not guarantee FDA approval. ICT01 is still in clinical trials and not yet available outside of these trials.

*Finding Clinical Trials:* Discuss clinical trial options with your oncologist. Search clinicaltrials.gov to see open trials.

## 2. Understanding Measurable Residual Disease (MRD)

MRD testing detects small amounts of leukemia cells remaining after treatment, even if standard tests don't find them. MRD should ideally be assessed from a bone marrow sample, but in patients with NPM1 or CBF-mutated AML, if there are a significant number of leukemia cells (blasts, specifically 20% or more) in their blood, MRD can sometimes be assessed from a blood sample instead. Knowing your MRD status helps your doctor understand your risk of relapse (the leukemia returning). MRD status can influence decisions regarding consolidation therapy, maintenance therapy, or the consideration of stem cell transplant. MRD negativity is a very positive sign but doesn't always guarantee a cure. Relapse is still possible even with undetectable MRD.

**What to Ask Your Doctor:** "What is MRD testing and is it relevant to my AML? What would MRD-positive or MRD-negative results mean for my treatment plan?"

## 3. Prognostic Factors and Risk Stratification

Genetic changes in AML cells, such as "translocations" (where parts of chromosomes swap places) or "mutations" (changes in individual genes), are key to understanding prognosis. Identifying these factors helps doctors tailor treatment intensity and type based on the patient's risk group (risk-adapted therapy). Risk stratification is not static and can be reassessed during and after treatment based on response and MRD status.

**What to Ask Your Doctor:** "What are my AML's specific genetic changes and what risk group do they place me in? How does this affect my treatment plan?"

*   **Favorable Changes:** Certain genetic changes, such as translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 (RUNX1-RUNX1T1) (often referred to as the 8;21 translocation), translocation or inversion of chromosome 16 (CBFB-MYH11), mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD, or biallelic mutated CEBPA, are associated with better outcomes.
*   **Unfavorable Changes:** Other changes, such as translocation between chromosomes 6 and 9 (DEK-NUP214), translocation at 11q23/3 (KMT2A rearranged), translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (BCR-ABL1), deletion of part of chromosome 5, 7, or 17, complex karyotype (the full set of chromosomes), mutated RUNX1, ASXL1, or TP53, are linked to poorer outcomes.

## 4. Managing Side Effects

AML treatments can cause side effects. Not everyone experiences all side effects, and their severity can vary. Proactive management and early reporting to your healthcare team are key.

*   **Common Side Effects:**
    *   **Myelosuppression:** Low blood counts, including neutropenia (increased risk of infection), anemia (fatigue), and thrombocytopenia (increased risk of bleeding). Myelosuppression is most likely to occur during and shortly after chemotherapy treatment cycles.
    *   **Nausea and Vomiting.**
    *   **Fatigue.**
    *   **Mouth sores (mucositis).**
    *   **Hair loss (alopecia).**
    *   **Infections.**

*   **General Management Strategies:**
    *   **For Myelosuppression:** Avoid crowds and sick people, practice good hygiene. Growth factors (like G-CSF) to boost white blood cell production, antibiotics to treat infections, and blood or platelet transfusions.
    *   **For Nausea:** Anti-nausea medications (antiemetics).
    *   **For Fatigue:** Pace activities, prioritize rest, and gentle exercise as tolerated. Discuss fatigue management with an oncology nurse or physical therapist. Addressing anemia can also help.
    *   **For Mouth Sores:** Good oral hygiene with a soft toothbrush and gentle mouthwashes (saline or baking soda rinse). Avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes. Consider a soft food diet if needed.

## 5. Support Groups and Resources

You are not alone. Many resources can help you and your family.

*   **Emotional Support:** Counseling, support groups, mental health professionals specialized in cancer.
*   **Practical Support:** Financial assistance, transportation, accommodation, co-pay assistance programs.
*   **Informational & Educational Support:** Disease-specific organizations, online resources, educational materials.
*   **Peer Support:** Online forums, patient communities, support groups connecting patients with others who have AML.

## 6. Key Points from AML Reports and Blood Work

Important information to track:

*   **Blast Percentage:** The percentage of blasts (immature blood cells) in the bone marrow or blood is critical for diagnosis. At least 20% blasts are generally required to diagnose AML if there are no diagnostic gene or chromosome changes.
*   **Chromosome and Gene Tests:** These tests help identify the specific type of AML you have. This information is crucial for determining your prognosis (outlook) and guiding treatment decisions.
*   **Molecular Testing:** This testing looks at genes, proteins, and other molecules in your leukemia cells. The results help doctors personalize your treatment plan, monitor how well treatment is working, and understand your prognosis.

## 7. New Clinical Trials

Clinical trials are essential for advancing AML treatment and are available for various stages of AML, not just relapse. Discuss clinical trial options with your doctors at any point in your AML journey.

*   **ALC8:** A treatment trial testing novel therapeutics, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies, for newly diagnosed, untreated AML patients. Patients interested in learning more about the ALC8 trial or other clinical trials can search the website clinicaltrials.gov using "ALC8" or "Acute Myeloid Leukemia" as search terms.

**Important Considerations:**

AML treatment is highly personalized. The best approach depends on your age, overall health, leukemia genetics, and response to initial therapy. Discuss your goals and concerns with your healthcare team to make informed decisions together.
