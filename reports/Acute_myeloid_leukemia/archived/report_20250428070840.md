# Understanding the Latest in AML: A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

This summary highlights recent advancements and resources related to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). It focuses on key information to help you navigate your journey.

**Important Note:** All cancer treatments have potential side effects. You should have a detailed discussion with your care team about the expected side effects of your specific prescribed treatment, including how to manage them and when to seek medical attention.

## 1. Advancements in AML Treatment

*   **GRAFAPEX (Approved):** The FDA approved GRAFAPEX (Medexus) in January 2025. Administered intravenously (IV), it's an alkylating agent used with fludarabine as *conditioning* before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT, a transplant using donor stem cells) in AML and MDS patients. *Conditioning* means preparing the body to receive donor cells by eliminating existing marrow and leukemia. *Status:* FDA Approved for alloHSCT preparation. *Actionable Information:* If alloHSCT is being considered, ask your doctor specifically about GRAFAPEX, its common side effects (e.g., mucositis (mouth sores), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and infection) and serious side effects (e.g., veno-occlusive disease (VOD), graft versus host disease (GVHD), and delayed engraftment) as part of the conditioning regimen, and what to expect during administration. This is not a general AML treatment, but a pre-transplant conditioning agent.

*   **Ziftomenib (Investigational):** A Phase II trial of ziftomenib, an oral menin inhibitor, showed positive results in relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant AML. Menin inhibitors work by blocking a protein involved in leukemia cell growth, particularly in cells with this specific mutation. These positive results included objective response rates. The company plans to submit an NDA to the FDA (request for approval to market the drug). *Status:* Investigational. Access is currently *only* through specific clinical trials. *Actionable Information:* If you have relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant AML, ask your doctor about ziftomenib and explore ClinicalTrials.gov. Eligibility for the trial will depend on specific criteria, and your doctor can check these against your profile. Common potential side effects observed in the Phase II trial included fatigue, nausea, and changes in blood counts.

*   **Iomab-B (Investigational):** Actinium Pharmaceuticals' Iomab-B, a targeted radioimmunotherapy (radiation delivered directly to cancer cells), helps improve access to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for patients with relapsed or refractory AML by targeting CD45. By targeting and reducing leukemia cells with radiation, it helps prepare your bone marrow for the transplant. *Status:* Investigational. *Actionable Information:* If you have relapsed/refractory AML and are considering a BMT, ask your doctor about Iomab-B as a potential conditioning regimen, and the potential side effects associated with radioimmunotherapy, such as myelosuppression (decreased blood cell production), infections, and infusion-related reactions.

*   **LYT-200 (Investigational):** PureTech Health's LYT-200, a galectin-9 inhibitor, is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for solid tumors and some hematologic malignancies. While the trial is in early stages, it is exploring the drug's potential in treating AML. *Status:* Investigational. *Actionable Information:* Ask your doctor if the LYT-200 trial is relevant to your specific type of AML, and what is the target patient population of this trial.

*   **FLT3, IDH, and BCL-2 Inhibitors (Approved):** Drugs like midostaurin, quizartinib, gilteritinib (FLT3 inhibitors), enasidenib, olutasidenib, ivosidenib (IDH inhibitors), and venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor) are standard treatments for patients with specific genetic mutations. These are often administered orally. Another major advancement involves combining venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor, with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) or low-dose cytarabine (LDAC). This combination targets BCL-2 and works differently than intensive chemotherapy, often allowing treatment outside the hospital, and is a standard of care for many older or less-fit patients. *Status:* FDA Approved for AML patients with specific mutations. *Actionable Information:* Your doctor will test for these mutations to see if you are eligible. Common and important potential side effects include differentiation syndrome with IDH inhibitors, myelosuppression with Venetoclax, and QT prolongation/cardiac effects with some FLT3 inhibitors like quizartinib/gilteritinib.

**Actionable Information:** If you are newly diagnosed or have relapsed AML, ask your doctor about genetic testing to see if you are eligible for any of the approved targeted therapies. Discuss clinical trial options for investigational drugs.

## 2. Understanding Measurable Residual Disease (MRD)

MRD refers to minimal amounts of leukemia remaining after treatment. It's detected using highly sensitive lab tests like flow cytometry or molecular genetic tests on blood or bone marrow samples. Flow cytometry looks at surface markers/proteins, while molecular tests look for specific DNA/RNA mutations.

*   **Why it Matters:** MRD detection helps assess treatment effectiveness and predict relapse.
*   **Actionable Information:** The presence or absence of MRD after treatment influences treatment decisions. MRD negativity is often a goal of treatment and is associated with a lower risk of relapse, whereas MRD positivity suggests a higher risk and may prompt further treatment intensification (like transplant or maintenance). If MRD is detected, your doctor might recommend a bone marrow transplant or maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. If MRD is not detected, you will still require close monitoring. Track your MRD results to understand if a bone marrow transplant or maintenance therapy will be needed.

## 3. Living with AML and Supportive Care

*   **Emotional Support:** Experiencing depression, anxiety, or worry is normal. Seek support from family, friends, support groups, and counselors.
*   **Managing the Long-Term Effects of AML and its Treatment:** Some individuals may require ongoing supportive treatments to manage the long-term effects of AML and its treatment. Examples include fatigue, cognitive changes, fertility issues, or graft-versus-host disease symptoms (for transplant patients). Maintaining physical and emotional well-being is crucial. *Actionable Information:* Ask your doctor about specific potential long-term effects based on *your* treatment plan and how to manage them. Discuss fertility preservation *before* starting treatments that can impact fertility, especially for younger patients.
*   **Palliative Care:** Palliative care focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life at any stage of the disease. It's not just for end-of-life care. It can help with pain, fatigue, nausea, and anxiety. Palliative care teams or social workers are often available at cancer centers.
    *   **Actionable Information:** Advocate for palliative care early to manage the side effects of the diagnosis and treatments.

## 4. Interpreting Blood Work and Diagnostic Tests

*   **Blood Tests:** These tests check the number and appearance of blood cells. Abnormal results may suggest leukemia. It's crucial for initial assessment and monitoring.
*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** A bone marrow sample is examined to confirm the diagnosis of leukemia and assess treatment effectiveness by measuring the blast percentage. These tests are often done *on the bone marrow biopsy sample*.
*   **Chromosomal Studies (Cytogenetics):** Identifies changes in chromosomes. Abnormalities can disrupt normal blood stem cell processes and influence treatment decisions. Certain genetic abnormalities can diagnose AML even if the blast percentage in the blood or marrow is below 20%. Examples of chromosomal abnormalities include t(8;21) and inv(16), which are generally considered favorable, while others have adverse effects.
*   **Immunophenotyping:** Examines proteins (antigens) on the surface of AML cells to determine the specific type of AML and guide treatment.
*   **Molecular Testing:** Looks for specific genetic mutations in AML cells. FLT3-ITD and TP53 mutations are examples that can influence prognosis.
    *   **Actionable Information:** Chromosomal studies, immunophenotyping, and molecular testing help classify AML subtype and identify targetable mutations. These tests determine if you are eligible for targeted therapies like FLT3, IDH, or BCL-2 inhibitors. Chromosomal abnormalities and mutations directly influence *prognosis* (how the disease is likely to behave) and *treatment choice*.
*   **Blast Percentage:** The percentage of blasts (immature cells) in the bone marrow or blood is crucial for diagnosis. A blast count of at least 20% in the marrow or blood is generally required for AML diagnosis.

**Actionable Information:** Understand that each test provides valuable information for diagnosis, risk stratification, and personalized treatment planning. Don't hesitate to ask your doctor to explain your test results and how they impact your care.
