# Understanding Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

## Understanding Your AML

AML is a complex disease with different subtypes determined by genetic mutations. These mutations are like "markers" that help doctors personalize your treatment.

*   **Genetic Mutations:** Specific gene changes impact treatment response:
    *   *FLT3* mutations often require FLT3 inhibitors alongside chemotherapy.
    *   *TP53* mutations can make AML harder to treat, potentially leading to clinical trials or earlier stem cell transplant consideration.
    *   *NPM1* mutations (without other abnormalities) and mutations in both copies of the *CEBPA* gene are generally linked to better outcomes with standard treatments.

*   **Measurable Residual Disease (MRD):** MRD testing detects small amounts of leukemia cells after treatment. MRD status is a strong predictor of relapse risk, potentially influencing stem cell transplant recommendations. Track MRD levels after treatment to understand how well the treatment worked.

*   **Age and Overall Health:** Age and overall health (often assessed by performance status) influence treatment options, potentially determining eligibility for intensive chemotherapy versus lower-intensity approaches.

*   **WHO Classification:** The World Health Organization (WHO) classification refines diagnosis and treatment strategies based on genetic abnormalities, AML cell differentiation, and history of prior therapy or blood disorders.

## New Treatment Options

### Approved Targeted Therapies

Targeted therapies attack specific parts of cancer cells. Side effects are possible and will be managed.

*   **FLT3 inhibitors:** Midostaurin (Rydapt) is often used with intensive chemo for newly diagnosed *FLT3*-mutated AML. Gilteritinib (Xospata) is approved for relapsed/refractory *FLT3*-mutated AML. Quizartinib (Vanflyta) is another option.
*   **IDH inhibitors:** Enasidenib (Idhifa), olutasidenib (Rezlidhia), and ivosidenib (Tibsovo) target mutated IDH1 or IDH2 proteins driving leukemia cell growth.
*   **BCL-2 inhibitors:** Venetoclax (Venclexta) is typically used *in combination* with other drugs like Azacitidine or Decitabine, especially for older adults or those ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.
*   **Menin inhibitors:** Revumenib is for relapsed/refractory AML with *KMT2A rearrangements* or *NPM1 mutations*, often after prior therapies.

### Other Treatments

*   **GRAFAPEX (plerixafor):** Helps mobilize stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream for collection *before* stem cell transplant.
*   **Iomab-B (Iodine I 131 apamistamab):** Approved as part of the conditioning regimen *before* stem cell transplant for relapsed/refractory AML patients aged 75 or younger.

### Investigational Therapies & Approaches (Clinical Trials)

*   **Immunotherapies:** Boost your immune system to fight cancer.
    *   **Immune checkpoint inhibitors:** Being studied in combination with chemotherapy or targeted therapy.
    *   **CAR T-cell therapy:** Uses modified immune cells to target cancer. Not standard first-line treatment for most AML patients in 2025.
    *   **CAR NK-cell therapy:** Being studied in clinical trials.

*   **GSK3 inhibitors:** *In research* or *early clinical trials*.

## Clinical Trials

Clinical trials test new treatments and may offer access to cutting-edge therapies. Discuss options with your doctor. Eligibility criteria are strict.

*   **Types of Clinical Trials:** Trials may test new drugs for newly diagnosed AML; address specific mutations like *TP53*; focus on patients who relapsed after transplant; aim to reduce side effects; or explore lower-intensity approaches.
*   **Finding Clinical Trials:** Your doctor is the best resource. You can also search databases like ClinicalTrials.gov.

## Understanding Bloodwork

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Peripheral Blood Smear:** Measures blood cells; often abnormal in AML.
*   **Blast Percentage:** Usually 20% or higher to diagnose AML. *Certain* genetic abnormalities can diagnose AML even with a lower percentage.
*   **Chromosome and Gene Tests:** Essential for understanding *your type* of AML and guiding treatment, especially targeted therapies.
*   **Cytogenetics (Karyotyping):** Identifies chromosome abnormalities.
*   **Molecular and Genetic Tests:** Identifies gene mutations to predict treatment response.

**Ask your doctor about your specific genetic test results, MRD status, and how these factors shape your treatment plan.**

## Important Considerations

*   **Treatment Side Effects:** Report *any* new or worsening side effects immediately. Seek immediate medical attention for signs of infection/fever, severe bleeding, severe shortness of breath, or signs of differentiation syndrome (with IDH inhibitors).
*   **Individualized Treatment:** Treatment is tailored to you.
*   **Relapse:** AML has a risk of relapse, but new options are being developed.
*   **Quality of Life:** Improving survival rates and quality of life are essential.
