# Understanding the Latest in AML: A Guide for Patients and Loved Ones (2024-2025)

This summary highlights recent advancements in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) research and treatment, focusing on information beneficial for patients and their families.

**Important Note:** Always consult your healthcare team for personalized medical advice. Treatment options and prognosis vary greatly depending on individual circumstances.

## Key Updates & Emerging Trends

Since 2017, many new treatments have become available for AML, offering hope for improved outcomes. Discuss potential side effects with your doctor.

### Targeted Therapies (for specific mutations)

*   **Midostaurin (FDA approved in 2017):** A FLT3 inhibitor for newly diagnosed AML with FLT3 mutations. It is taken orally. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and low blood cell counts. It is used in combination with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML.
*   **Gilteritinib (FDA approved in 2018):** Another FLT3 inhibitor for relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutations. It is taken orally. Common side effects include diarrhea, fatigue, and liver enzyme elevations.
*   **Quizartinib (FDA approved in 2023):** A FLT3 inhibitor for adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3-ITD mutations (requires FDA-approved test). It is taken orally. Side effects can include QT prolongation (an effect on the heart's electrical activity) and fatigue.
*   **Ivosidenib (FDA approved in 2018):** An IDH1 inhibitor for relapsed or refractory AML with IDH1 mutations. It is taken orally. Side effects can include differentiation syndrome (a potentially serious condition requiring prompt treatment) and nausea.
*   **Enasidenib (FDA approved in 2017):** An IDH2 inhibitor for relapsed or refractory AML with IDH2 mutations. It is taken orally. Side effects can include differentiation syndrome and nausea.
*   **Olutasidenib (FDA approved in 2022):** An IDH1 inhibitor for relapsed or refractory AML with IDH1 mutations. It is taken orally. Common side effects include nausea, fatigue, and joint pain.
*   **Revumenib (FDA approved in 2024):** A Menin inhibitor for relapsed or refractory AML with KMT2A-rearrangement (MLL-rearrangement). It is taken orally. Common side effects include QT prolongation and differentiation syndrome.

### Chemotherapy Combinations/Formulations

*   **Venetoclax (FDA approved in 2018):** A BCL-2 inhibitor often combined with chemotherapy or azacitidine, especially for older adults. Helps restore programmed cell death in leukemia cells. It is taken orally. A common side effect is myelosuppression (low blood cell counts).
*   **Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (FDA approved in 2017):** An antibody-drug conjugate delivering chemotherapy directly to AML cells targeting the CD33 protein. It's like a guided missile that targets CD33 on AML cells to deliver chemotherapy directly. It is given as an IV infusion.
*   **CPX-351 (FDA approved in 2017):** A liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine for adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML that developed from a prior bone marrow disorder). This special formulation helps deliver the chemotherapy drugs more effectively to leukemia cells and reduce side effects. It is given as an IV infusion.
*   **Oral Azacitidine (FDA approved in 2020):** An oral form of azacitidine to help prevent leukemia cells from growing.

### Other Mechanisms

*   **Glasdegib (FDA approved in 2018):** A Hedgehog pathway inhibitor combined with low-dose cytarabine for older adults with newly diagnosed AML who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy. It is taken orally.

### CAR-T Cell Therapy

CAR-T cell therapy is **currently experimental and being investigated in clinical trials** for secondary AML (sAML). This cutting-edge therapy involves collecting a patient's T cells (a type of immune cell), modifying them in the laboratory to specifically target AML cells, and then infusing these modified CAR-T cells back into the patient to fight the cancer.  **It is not a standard treatment** for AML and is primarily available through **clinical trials**. CAR-T therapy can have significant side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, which are closely managed by medical teams. Patients interested in CAR-T cell therapy for AML should discuss clinical trial options with their oncologist.

### Combination Therapies

**In very early, preclinical research**, scientists are exploring combination therapies involving MCL-1 inhibitors with SRC kinase inhibitors.

### PSPC1 as a Drug Target

Scientists have **discovered in laboratory studies** that inhibiting PSPC1 could be a potential future area of research.

### KME-0584

A **Phase 1** clinical trial for KME-0584 **is expected to begin** in early 2025 for relapsed AML and high-risk MDS. KME-0584 inhibits two critical proteins associated with these conditions. **(Phase 1 trials are designed to primarily assess safety)**. Discuss clinical trial options with your oncologist or consult clinicaltrials.gov.

## Prognostic Factors & Risk Stratification

Factors influencing AML prognosis:

*   **Age:** Patients over 60 generally have a less favorable prognosis.
*   **White Blood Cell Count:** High count at diagnosis = less favorable prognosis.
*   **Prior Blood Disorders/Treatment-Related AML:** Less favorable prognosis.
*   **Measurable Residual Disease (MRD):** Presence after treatment negatively affects outlook.

### Genetic Factors

*   **More favorable prognosis:** *NPM1* (gene involved in cell growth and protein production), *CEBPA* (gene important for blood cell development). (*NPM1* prognosis is variable depending on co-occuring mutations; favorable prognosis is generally associated with *NPM1* mutations in the absence of high-risk mutations).
*   **Less favorable prognosis:** *FLT3-ITD* (gene that helps cells grow; mutations can cause uncontrolled growth), *TP53* (tumor suppressor gene; mutations can lead to cancer development and treatment resistance), *RUNX1*, *ASXL1*.

***Disclaimer:** Prognosis is complex and depends on many factors. Discuss your individual prognosis and risk factors with your doctor to understand your specific situation.*

### Chromosome Abnormalities

Specific chromosome abnormalities can be favorable or unfavorable.

## Understanding Blood Work & Reports

What to look for:

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Identifies low red blood cells (anemia), low platelets (thrombocytopenia), and abnormal white blood cell counts.
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:** Identifies blast cells (immature leukemia cells).
*   **Bone Marrow Tests:** Essential for diagnosis (blast cells â‰¥ 20%). This procedure is typically performed with local anesthetic to minimize discomfort, and any discomfort is usually temporary. It involves taking a small sample of bone marrow to examine the cells.
*   **Genetic Tests:** Identifies AML subtype and mutations to guide treatment decisions.
    *   **Immunohistochemistry and Flow Cytometry:** To identify specific proteins on leukemia cells, helping to classify the AML subtype.
    *   **Karyotype Test:** To analyze chromosomes for large-scale abnormalities that can impact prognosis and treatment.
    *   **FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization):** To detect specific gene or chromosome abnormalities that may be missed by karyotyping and are important for targeted therapy decisions.
*   **Imaging Tests:** Checks if AML has affected organs like the spleen or lymph nodes.

## Support Resources

*   **Financial Assistance:** The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) ([www.LLS.org](www.LLS.org))

*   **Clinical Trials:** Ask your doctor or search clinicaltrials.gov.
*   **Second Opinions:** Seek a second opinion if desired.
*   **Caregiver Support:** Resources are available for caregivers, including counseling and support groups. Organizations like CancerCare and LLS also offer caregiver-specific support.
*   **Consult Your Healthcare Team:** Remember to discuss all treatment options and potential side effects with your healthcare team to make informed decisions that are right for you.
