## Recent Advances in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): A Guide for Patients and Families

This summary highlights recent information on AML, focusing on treatment, support, and patient care. We emphasize new developments to help you navigate your journey. *Always discuss treatment options and test results with your oncologist.* This summary provides general information about recent advances in AML research and is intended for educational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with your oncologist or other qualified healthcare provider for any questions you may have regarding your medical condition or treatment.

### 1. Breakthroughs in AML Treatment

*   **GRAFAPEX (Arsenic Trioxide) for AlloHSCT:** GRAFAPEX, an intravenous formulation of arsenic trioxide, is *FDA-approved* for use with fludarabine in alloHSCT (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) conditioning regimens for AML and MDS (myelodysplastic syndromes) patients. AlloHSCT involves receiving stem cells from a donor. A *conditioning regimen* is intensive treatment, often involving chemotherapy and/or radiation, given before a stem cell transplant to prepare your body by making space in your bone marrow for the new stem cells and suppressing your immune system to prevent rejection. GRAFAPEX, as part of the conditioning regimen, helps prepare your body for transplant.
*   **AUTX-703: Fast Track Designation:** AUTX-703 is a novel cell therapy that is currently in clinical trials for relapsed or refractory AML, meaning AML that has returned after treatment or has not responded to initial treatment. It has received fast track designation from the FDA for relapsed/refractory AML.
*   **Targeted Therapies Based on Mutations:** The treatment landscape is evolving rapidly, with therapies targeting specific genetic mutations. Knowing your AML's mutations (FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, TP53, NPM1, and KMT2A) is crucial. It's important to remember that the suitability of these targeted therapies depends on the specific mutations your AML has and other individual factors. Discuss with your oncologist if targeted therapy is an appropriate option for you, and what the eligibility criteria are. Common targeted therapies include:
    *   **VYXEOS:** *FDA-approved* for specific types of AML, including secondary AML (AML that develops after a previous blood disorder or prior chemotherapy/radiation) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML that arises from or has features of myelodysplastic syndromes, a group of disorders where the bone marrow does not produce enough healthy blood cells).
    *   **RYDAPT (midostaurin):** *FDA-approved* for *newly diagnosed* AML with FLT3-ITD mutations, used *in combination with chemotherapy*. Common side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
    *   **ONUREG (azacitidine):** *FDA-approved* for *maintenance therapy* to *extend* remission *after* achieving initial remission from prior AML treatment. ONUREG is used as maintenance therapy, which means it is given after you have achieved remission (when signs and symptoms of leukemia have decreased or disappeared) from prior AML treatment. The goal of maintenance therapy is to help prevent the leukemia from returning and extend the duration of remission. Common side effects: nausea, vomiting, fatigue.
    *   **DAURISMO (glasdegib):** *FDA-approved* for *newly diagnosed* AML, used *in combination with chemotherapy*. Common side effects: fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite.
    *   **TIBSOVO (ivosidenib):** *FDA-approved* for AML with IDH1 mutations. Common side effects: fatigue, nausea, diarrhea.
    *   **VENCLEXTA (venetoclax):** *FDA-approved*. Often used *in combination with hypomethylating agents*. Common side effects: nausea, diarrhea, low blood cell counts, and Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS). Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) is a condition that can occur when cancer cells break down rapidly after treatment, releasing their contents into the bloodstream. This can cause imbalances in electrolytes and kidney problems. Your healthcare team will monitor you closely for TLS, especially when starting VENCLEXTA, and take steps to prevent or manage it, such as ensuring you are well-hydrated. Monitoring and mitigation strategies are important, especially when starting treatment.
*   **Ziftomenib: Targeting NPM1 Mutations:** Kura Oncology's ziftomenib, a selective oral menin inhibitor, has shown positive results in a Phase II trial for relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant AML. It is *currently under FDA review* and *not yet approved*.

### 2. Understanding Your AML Diagnosis and Reports

*   **The Importance of Testing:** Diagnosing AML involves blood tests and bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. The percentage of blasts (immature cells) is critical for diagnosis.
*   **Genetic Testing:** Identifying mutations like FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, TP53, KMT2A and NPM1 is crucial because they can guide treatment decisions and provide prognostic information. Prognosis refers to the likely course or outcome of your disease. Certain genetic mutations and chromosome abnormalities can help doctors understand how aggressive your AML might be and how well it might respond to treatment.
*   **Cytogenetics (Karyotyping):** This test examines chromosomes to identify abnormalities. It helps determine the type of AML, prognosis, and treatment options. Prognosis refers to the likely course or outcome of your disease. Certain genetic mutations and chromosome abnormalities can help doctors understand how aggressive your AML might be and how well it might respond to treatment.
*   **Measurable Residual Disease (MRD):** Highly sensitive tests (like flow cytometry and PCR) detect minimal amounts of leukemia after treatment, helping optimize management.
*   **Understanding Blood Counts:** Common blood count parameters to track include:
    *   **White Blood Cells (WBC):** Fight infection. Low counts (neutropenia) increase infection risk.
    *   **Neutrophils:** A type of WBC. Low counts (absolute neutrophil count or ANC) indicate higher risk of infection.
    *   **Hemoglobin (Hgb):** Carries oxygen. Normal Hemoglobin levels are typically higher, and low levels (anemia) cause fatigue and shortness of breath.
    *   **Platelets:** Help with blood clotting. Low levels (thrombocytopenia) increase the risk of bleeding.

### 3. Managing Treatment Side Effects

*   **Supportive Care:** Supportive care is a crucial part of AML treatment and focuses on managing side effects and improving your quality of life. This can include medications to prevent infections, manage nausea, pain relief, blood transfusions, nutritional support, and emotional support. You'll receive supportive care to manage side effects like myelosuppression (low blood cell counts).
*   **Nutrition:** Focus on food safety (avoiding raw/undercooked foods, washing produce thoroughly) and gentle dietary approaches (eating bland foods if nauseous, softer foods if you have mouth sores).
*   **Chemotherapy Side Effects:** Your doctor may prescribe anti-nausea medications, growth factors, or special mouthwash for mucositis.
*   **Low Blood Cell Counts:**
    *   **Anemia:** Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or red blood cell transfusions may be needed.
    *   **Thrombocytopenia:** Thrombopoietin receptor agonists or platelet transfusions may be needed.
    *   **Neutropenia:** Preventing infection is crucial. Practice hand hygiene, avoid crowds when counts are low, and promptly report fever or signs of infection to your healthcare team. Prophylactic antibiotics or antifungals might be prescribed.

### 4. Patient Support and Resources

*   **The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS):** Financial assistance programs, peer-to-peer support groups, and educational materials specifically for AML.
*   **CancerCare:** Free professional counseling services, support groups led by oncology social workers, financial navigation assistance.
*   **HealthTree Foundation:** HealthTree Cure Hub platform for personalized information, patient matching services for clinical trials.
*   **The American Cancer Society (ACS):** Road To Recovery transportation program, Hope Lodge lodging for patients traveling for treatment.

### 5. Clinical Trials

*   Clinical trials are crucial for finding new and more effective treatments for AML. Trials are conducted in different phases (Phase 1, 2, 3), and trials in all phases are important for advancing AML treatment. Discuss clinical trial options with your oncologist. You can also search at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and on the LLS website ([LLS.org](https://www.lls.org/)).

### Important Considerations

*   **Second Opinions:** Getting a second opinion can provide valuable insights and alternative treatment approaches.
*   **Individualized Treatment Plans:** Treatment should be tailored to your specific situation.
*   **Always discuss treatment options and test results with your oncologist.**
