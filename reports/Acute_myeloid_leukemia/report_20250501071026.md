# Understanding the Latest in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Research: A Guide for Patients and Loved Ones

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This summary highlights recent advancements in AML treatment and support, designed to empower you with knowledge. **Discuss all treatment options and potential side effects with your doctor.**

## Currently Approved AML Treatments

Your doctor will determine the best treatment plan for you, which may include: **The specific combination and sequence of treatments are highly individualized and depend on your AML characteristics and health status. Each drug and combination has a unique side effect profile that your doctor will discuss with you.**

*   **Chemotherapy:** Kills cancer cells, often with drugs like cytarabine and an anthracycline.
*   **Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT):** Replaces damaged bone marrow with healthy cells.
*   **Targeted Therapies:** Medications that target specific AML cell characteristics:
    *   **Midostaurin (Rydapt):** *Newly diagnosed* AML with FLT3 mutations, used with chemotherapy.
    *   **Gilteritinib (Xospata):** *Relapsed or refractory* AML with FLT3 mutations.
    *   **Ivosidenib (Tibsovo):** *Newly diagnosed* (with azacitidine or alone) or *relapsed/refractory* AML with IDH1 mutations.
    *   **Enasidenib (Idhifa):** *Relapsed or refractory* AML with IDH2 mutations.
    *   **Venetoclax (Venclexta):** Targets BCL-2 protein, often with azacitidine or low-dose cytarabine, especially for older patients.
    *   **Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg):** A CD33-directed antibody-drug conjugate.

## Emerging AML Therapies: What's on the Horizon?

These therapies are being researched in clinical trials and are *not* yet standard treatments. **Eligibility for clinical trials is specific, depending on your health, prior treatments, and lab results.**

### Drugs Under FDA Review

*   **Ziftomenib:** Expected FDA submission in Q2 2025.
    *   **What it is:** A Menin inhibitor for AML with *KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-r)* and/or *NPM1 mutations (NPM1m)*.
    *   **Targets:** Inhibits Menin-KMT2A interaction.
    *   **Clinical Trial Results:** The KOMET-001 Phase II trial showed *promising response rates*.
    *   **Important Note:** *Not yet FDA approved* and available *only* through clinical trials. The *safety profile is being actively evaluated in trials* and will be discussed with potential participants.

### Drugs in Clinical Trials

*   **GRAFAPEX (Busulfan):** An extended-release form of Busulfan, used before alloHSCT (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation).
    *   **What it is:** Improves conditioning before transplant, aiming for consistent drug levels and potentially reduced *liver* toxicity. Busulfan is a *high-dose* chemotherapy used to clear existing bone marrow cells before the new stem cells are introduced.
    *   **Why it Matters:** A potentially gentler way to prepare for transplant.
    *   **Important Note:** Used for conditioning *before* allogeneic HSCT. Discuss potential side effects with your doctor, which may include nausea, mucositis, and risk of infection.
*   **LYT-200:** Received Fast Track Designation.
    *   **What it is:** An antibody targeting Galectin-3, thought to help AML cells survive.
    *   **Important Note:** Still investigational; available only through clinical trials. The safety profile is under investigation in trials and potential side effects will be discussed with trial participants.
*   **ICT01 (with azacitidine and venetoclax):** Received Fast Track Designation.
    *   **What it is:** An antibody activating immune cells (like NK cells) by targeting the NKG2D receptor.
    *   **Important Note:** Still investigational; available only through clinical trials. The safety profile is under investigation in trials and potential side effects will be discussed with trial participants.
*   **SLS009:**
    *   **What it is:** An inhibitor targeting the BCL-2 protein, similar to Venetoclax.
    *   **Important Note:** Still investigational; available only through clinical trials. The safety profile is under investigation in trials and potential side effects will be discussed with trial participants.
*   **Revumenib:** A Menin inhibitor. Currently in clinical trials.
    *   **Targets:** For AML with KMT2A rearrangements or NPM1 mutations. The safety profile is under investigation in trials and potential side effects will be discussed with trial participants.
*   **Crenolanib:** A type III/FLT3 inhibitor. Currently in clinical trials.
    *   **Targets:** For FLT3-mutated AML, particularly in patients who may have developed resistance to other FLT3 inhibitors. The safety profile is under investigation in trials and potential side effects will be discussed with trial participants.
*   **SENTI-202 (CAR NK Cell Therapy):** Achieved complete remission in some patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML in a Phase 1 trial.
    *   **What it is:** Genetically engineered natural killer (NK) cells to target AML.
    *   **Important Note:** Phase 1 trials primarily test *safety and determine the right dose*. Results are *preliminary* and represent *early signs* of potential effectiveness. Common side effects specific to CAR/NK therapies (like cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurological effects) are closely monitored and managed by the trial team.

### Other Emerging Strategies

*   **Gene editing, CRISPR gene therapy, and CAR-T cell therapies:** Targeting leukemia stem cells.
    *   **Important Note:** Highly experimental and in very early stages of research.

## Understanding AML Treatment Approaches

*   **Measurable Residual Disease (MRD):** Detects minimal leukemia left after treatment.
    *   **What it is:** Tests (flow cytometry, PCR, NGS) that guide treatment decisions.
    *   **Why it Matters:** MRD negativity is a goal, linked to lower relapse risk. This can help guide decisions about whether more treatment is needed, if a transplant is appropriate, or if a particular therapy is working effectively.
*   **Differentiation Therapy:** Agents like IDH1/IDH2 inhibitors (approved) and LSD1 and Menin inhibitors (investigational) to make leukemia cells mature.
*   **Risk Stratification:** Determines the best treatment.
    *   **What it is:** Considers age, health, cytogenetics (chromosome analysis), and molecular markers (gene mutations).
    *   **Why it Matters:** Guides treatment intensity and transplant decisions.
*   **PSPC1 Target:** Depleting PSPC1 delayed disease progression in mice.
    *   **Important Note:** Early-stage research; not yet a clinical treatment.
