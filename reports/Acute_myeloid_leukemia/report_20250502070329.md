# Understanding the Latest in AML: A Guide for Patients and Loved Ones

This summary highlights recent advancements and key information about Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) to help you navigate your journey with more confidence.

## Key Updates & Emerging Treatments

Here's what's new in AML treatments and what it could mean for you.

*   **Sykfos® (Revumenib):** Approved in December 2023 for relapsed/refractory AML with a KMT2A rearrangement or KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2Ar) AML (affecting both adults and children 1+). Revumenib is a "menin inhibitor." In the AUGMENT-101 trial, it showed a 21% complete remission (CR) rate in heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory AML with KMT2A translocations. Achieving CR in this setting is clinically significant. About 34% of responding patients proceeded to stem cell transplant; achieving remission is typically a prerequisite for transplant. **Important:** Common side effects include differentiation syndrome (fever, breathing problems, rapid weight gain), QTc prolongation (heart rhythm issue), myelosuppression (low blood counts increasing infection/bleeding risk), infections, nausea, diarrhea, fever, headache, abdominal pain, and febrile neutropenia. **Action:** Discuss these potential side effects and monitoring strategies with your doctor.

*   **Ziftomenib:** *Investigational* and currently *awaiting FDA approval* (NDA submitted March 2024) for relapsed/refractory AML with an NPM1 mutation. The FDA is reviewing the application and granted it priority review, with a decision expected around September 2024. This "menin inhibitor" had encouraging results in a Phase 2 trial ("KICKSTART"), with approximately a 30% complete remission (CR) rate and a 40% composite CR rate (CR + CRh). Achieving a CR or composite CR rate of around 30-40% in relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutated AML is considered encouraging. **Important:** Potential side effects observed include differentiation syndrome, myelosuppression, infections, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, febrile neutropenia, and elevated liver enzymes. **Action:** If you have an NPM1 mutation and are considering treatment options for relapsed or refractory AML, ask your doctor if Ziftomenib, if approved, might be a suitable option, or if there are clinical trials available studying it.

*   **GRAFAPEX (Treosulfan):** Approved in October 2023 for preparing AML and MDS patients for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). GRAFAPEX is an *alkylating agent* used *as part of* the conditioning regimen. Briefly, conditioning prepares the body for the transplant by eliminating leukemia cells and suppressing the immune system to prevent rejection of the new stem cells. GRAFAPEX is used in combination with fludarabine. **Important:** Side effects associated with this conditioning regimen component may include myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, risk of infection, veno-occlusive disease and mucositis. **Action:** Understand the potential risks and benefits of this conditioning regimen with your transplant team.

*   **IPH4701:** Granted "Fast Track Designation" by the FDA for older (75+) or unfit AML patients, to be used with azacitidine and venetoclax. IPH4701 is a CD47/SIRPα blocker, a type of immunotherapy. IPH4701 is an *investigational drug* and is *only available* through *clinical trials*. Fast Track Designation speeds up the *review process* if trial data supports approval, but it does not mean the drug is approved or available for clinical use yet. **What does "Fast Track" mean?** The FDA is trying to speed up the review of this drug because it may help people with serious conditions where there is an unmet need. **Action:** While early data is still being gathered, discuss with your doctor if this *investigational* combination is a possibility through participation in a clinical trial, particularly if you are older or have difficulty tolerating standard chemotherapy.

## Ongoing Research & Clinical Trials

*   **Menin Inhibitors:** Showing promise for AML with specific genetic mutations. Menin inhibitors target specific proteins involved in AML cell growth.
*   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** Exploring CAR T-cell therapies targeting CD33, CD123, and other targets. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy where a patient's own T-cells are modified to better recognize and attack cancer cells.
*   **CER-1236:** Phase 1 trial starting for relapsed/refractory MRD-positive AML.
*   **Bleximenib:** Being investigated with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML and alone for relapsed/refractory acute leukemia.

**Action:**

*   **Find Clinical Trials:** Talk to your oncologist or search [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) for relevant trials. Participation in a clinical trial often involves frequent visits, additional tests, and specific eligibility criteria that are often very strict and change over time. Navigating ClinicalTrials.gov can be complex; work closely with your oncologist or a research nurse to identify relevant trials.
*   **Understand Eligibility:** Trial eligibility often depends on factors like specific mutations, prior treatments, and overall health ("performance status").

## Understanding Reports & Bloodwork: Key to Informed Decisions

Understanding your test results can help you make informed decisions about your care.

*   **Cytogenetic Analysis:** This analyzes chromosomes to identify abnormalities. It helps determine risk categories (favorable, intermediate, adverse). These categories help predict treatment response and guide therapy intensity.
    *   **Favorable:** Examples include t(8;21) and inv(16).
    *   **Intermediate:** Examples include normal karyotype, t(9;11), or other abnormalities not falling into favorable or adverse groups.
    *   **Adverse:** Examples include complex karyotype, monosomy 5/7, and *TP53* mutation.
    *   **Importance:** Knowing your risk category helps tailor your treatment plan for the best possible outcome.

**How to Understand Reports:**

1.  **Ask Your Doctor:** Request they explain the report findings in simple terms.
2.  **Prepare Questions:** Write down your questions beforehand.
3.  **Get a Copy:** Obtain a copy of the report for your records.

**Common Report Sections:**

*   **Morphology:** Describes the appearance of cells under a microscope.
*   **Immunophenotype:** Identifies proteins on the surface of cells, helping to classify the AML subtype.
*   **Cytogenetics:** Analyzes chromosomes for abnormalities (as described above).
*   **Molecular Findings:** Identifies specific gene mutations. Identifying specific gene mutations is crucial because some mutations, like FLT3, NPM1, IDH1, or IDH2, predict how the AML might behave and can guide the use of specific targeted therapies. Other mutations (e.g., *TP53*, *ASXL1*, *RUNX1*, *SF3B1*, *SRSF2*) are also important and used in risk stratification, even if they don't currently have targeted therapies.

*   **Measurable Residual Disease (MRD):** This indicates the small number of leukemia cells remaining after treatment. The goal is often to achieve "MRD negativity." Common methods include multi-parameter flow cytometry and PCR for specific mutations. Achieving MRD negativity is associated with better outcomes but is not a guarantee of cure, and the clinical significance can vary based on AML subtype and detection method. **Action:** Understanding your MRD status helps guide treatment decisions (e.g., maintenance therapy).

*   **FLT3-ITD:** If you have this mutation, targeted therapies may improve survival. Examples include:
    *   Midostaurin: Approved for newly diagnosed AML with FLT3 mutations (ITD or TKD) *in combination with chemotherapy*.
    *   Gilteritinib: Approved for relapsed/refractory AML with FLT3 mutations (ITD or TKD).
    *   Quizartinib: Approved for newly diagnosed AML with FLT3-ITD mutation *in combination with chemotherapy* and for relapsed/refractory AML with FLT3-ITD.
    *   Fedratinib: Approved for relapsed/refractory AML with FLT3-ITD.
    *   FLT3-TKD (Tyrosine Kinase Domain) mutations are another type of FLT3 mutation that can be targeted by some of these inhibitors.

*   **IDH1 and IDH2 Mutations:** Mutations in these genes can be targeted with specific FDA-approved therapies like:
    *   Ivosidenib (Tibsovo®): Approved for newly diagnosed AML with an IDH1 mutation *in older or unfit patients* and for relapsed/refractory AML with an IDH1 mutation.
    *   Enasidenib (Idhifa®): Approved for relapsed/refractory AML with an IDH2 mutation.

*   **Key Blood Count Parameters:**
    *   **White Blood Cell (WBC) count:** High in AML due to immature cells (blasts).
    *   **Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC):** Low ANC (neutropenia) increases infection risk.
    *   **Platelet Count:** Low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) increase bleeding risk.
    *   **Hemoglobin:** Low hemoglobin (anemia) causes fatigue and shortness of breath.

## Living with AML & Support

*   **Comprehensive Care:** Seek treatment at a specialized AML center.
*   **Managing Side Effects:** Common side effects include fatigue, hair loss, fever/infection risk, nausea, diarrhea, mouth sores, and changes in taste or appetite. **Action:** Proactively communicate any new or worsening symptoms to your care team.
*   **Nutrition:**
    *   Balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
    *   Limit red, grilled, or processed meats.
    *   Increase fiber intake.
    *   Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly.
    *   Practice food safety to prevent infections.
*   **Food Safety:** For immunocompromised patients, specific precautions are crucial.
    *   Wash all raw fruits and vegetables thoroughly under running water before eating.
    *   Avoid raw or undercooked meat, poultry, fish, and eggs.
    *   Avoid unpasteurized dairy products and juices.
    *   Avoid deli meats and soft cheeses unless heated until steaming hot.
    *   Be cautious with restaurant buffets and salad bars.
    *   Ensure safe food handling, preparation, and storage at home.

*   **Practical Tips for Managing Common Side Effects:**
    *   **Fatigue:** Pace activities, prioritize rest, short naps if needed, gentle exercise if approved by doctor.
    *   **Infection Risk (Neutropenia):** Frequent hand washing, avoid sick people and large crowds, wear a mask in public spaces, report fever immediately.
    *   **Mouth Sores (Mucositis):** Gentle oral hygiene (soft toothbrush), saline or baking soda rinses, avoid spicy/acidic/hard/hot foods, use mouth rinses as prescribed.
*   **Quitting Smoking:** Crucial for overall health and recovery.
*   **Psychosocial Support:** Seek support through psychiatric consultation, social workers, and case managers.
*   **Financial Assistance:** Contact CancerCare for financial resources and support.
*   **Support Systems:**
    *   CancerCare: 800-813-HOPE
    *   Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS)
    *   American Cancer Society
    *   NCCN guidelines are primarily for healthcare professionals, but patient-friendly summaries or resources based on these guidelines are often available through patient advocacy groups like LLS or CancerCare.

## Important Considerations

*   **Prognostic Scores:** These scores combine age, performance status, initial WBC count, and genetic/molecular findings to predict outcomes and guide treatment. The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk stratification system is a widely used framework that integrates cytogenetics and molecular findings (like NPM1, FLT3-ITD/TKD, CEBPA biallelic, etc.) to categorize patients into favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk groups.
*   **Age & Fitness:** Treatment is tailored based on age, fitness level, and AML characteristics.
