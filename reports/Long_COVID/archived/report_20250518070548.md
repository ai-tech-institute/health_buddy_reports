# Understanding Long COVID: A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

Long COVID isn't a single disease, but a collection of conditions triggered by the initial COVID-19 infection. Symptoms and treatments vary significantly. Focus on tracking your symptoms and advocating for personalized care.

## How Common is Long COVID?

Estimates range from 6% to 30% of people with symptomatic COVID-19. Millions worldwide are affected. These estimates vary based on different studies and Long COVID definitions.

## Symptoms to Track & What They Might Mean:

Besides fatigue, brain fog, and shortness of breath, watch for:

*   **Post-exertional malaise (PEM):** Worsening of symptoms after physical or mental effort. *Action:* Pace activities to avoid overexertion. Rest when needed.
*   **POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome):** Rapid heart rate upon standing. *Action:* Monitor heart rate changes upon standing. Stay hydrated. Consider compression stockings. Consult a cardiologist.
*   **Internal tremors:** Feeling of shaking inside your body. *Action:* Discuss with your doctor to rule out other conditions and explore potential management strategies.
*   **Hormonal changes:** Changes in menstrual cycle, thyroid function, etc. *Action:* Consult an endocrinologist for evaluation and management.
*   **Sleep problems:** Insomnia, disrupted sleep. *Action:* Practice good sleep hygiene. Consider a sleep study. Explore cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).

**Track Your Symptoms:** Log your symptoms (start date, frequency, severity, triggers, and relieving factors). Use a scale of 1-10 for severity. This record will be valuable for your healthcare provider. This can help identify patterns and inform treatment decisions.

## Are You at Higher Risk?

Potential risk factors may include:

*   Sleep apnea
*   Diabetes
*   Female sex
*   Older age
*   Severity of initial COVID-19 infection
*   Pre-existing conditions (asthma, autoimmune disorders)
*   Possible genetic factors (under research)

## Diagnosis: What to Expect

*   **No Single Test:** Diagnosis relies on medical history, physical exam, and excluding other conditions.
*   **Biomarkers (Research Only):** Researchers are looking at blood markers that *might* indicate Long COVID, potentially suggesting ongoing inflammation or remnants of the virus. *Important:* These are *research findings* and *not* standard diagnostic tests available to patients.
*   **Attomarker Test (Research Only):** Currently available only in research settings. Its clinical significance for Long COVID patients is still being investigated.

## Treatment Options and Clinical Trials: Where to Find Help

Targeted treatments are key, addressing specific underlying issues.

*   **Clinical Trials Offering Hope:** Search ClinicalTrials.gov for trials. When searching, look for eligibility criteria related to symptom duration, specific Long COVID symptoms, presence/absence of other medical conditions, and prior Long COVID treatments.

    *   **AER002:** Phase unknown. A long-acting human immunoglobulin aimed at neutralizing the virus's spike protein. *Type:* Antibody treatment. *Goal:* To directly neutralize the virus, potentially addressing viral persistence and subsequent immune response.
    *   **Baricitinib:** Phase unknown. An immunomodulatory drug for immune dysregulation and chronic inflammation. *Type:* Immunomodulator, currently approved for rheumatoid arthritis. *Goal:* To reduce inflammation. *Important:* Use for Long COVID is experimental. Common side effects associated with JAK inhibitors like Baricitinib include increased risk of infection and blood clots. Mild nausea or headache are also possible. Refer to FDA prescribing information for comprehensive lists.
    *   **Sipavibart:** Phase unknown. AstraZeneca's long-acting monoclonal antibody. *Type:* Antibody treatment. *Goal:* To evaluate its safety and potential effectiveness in reducing Long COVID symptoms.
    *   **Upadacitinib and pirfenidone:** Phase unknown. Two anti-inflammatory medicines. *Type:* Anti-inflammatory, currently approved for rheumatoid arthritis. *Goal:* To reduce inflammation. *Important:* Use for Long COVID is experimental. Common side effects of Upadacitinib (another JAK inhibitor) include increased risk of infection and blood clots. Mild nausea or headache are also possible. Common side effects of Pirfenidone include gastrointestinal issues and sensitivity to sunlight. Refer to FDA prescribing information for comprehensive lists.

    *   *Important Note:* These treatments are generally *only* available through clinical trial participation.

*   **WEHI Compound (Preclinical):** Shows promise in mice, but years of research are needed before potential human use.

*   **Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) - Off-Label Use:** *Extended* treatment with Paxlovid *may* reduce Long COVID symptoms in *certain* patients.

    *   *Important Considerations:*
        *   Extended Paxlovid use is *not* FDA-approved ("off-label").
        *   Discuss risks, benefits, and side effects (taste disturbance, drug interactions, kidney effects) with your doctor. Ritonavir interactions are a concern. Be aware of the "rebound" phenomenon.

*   **Failed Clinical Trials:** Temelimab and BC007 have been discontinued.

## RECOVER-TLC Initiative

NIH-supported initiative to understand Long COVID through studies, data, and potential treatment trials. Participate if possible.

## Finding Support and Information

*   **Support Groups:** Many exist, including those for specific demographics or conditions.
*   **International Long COVID Awareness Day (March 15th):** A day to raise awareness.
*   **CDC Resources:** The CDC is working to address Long COVID's long-term impacts.

## What You Can Do: Key Considerations

*   **Advocate for Yourself:** Your symptoms are real. Seek a second opinion if needed.
*   **Holistic Approach:** Consider a combination of:
    *   Physical rehabilitation
    *   Psychological therapies:
        *   CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy): Manage symptoms and change thought patterns.
        *   ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy): Improve coping skills.
    *   Group therapy and peer support

*   **Individualized Treatment:** Work with your healthcare provider on a personalized plan based on your symptoms and potential underlying causes.
