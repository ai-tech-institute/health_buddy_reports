# Understanding Long COVID: A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

This summary provides the latest information on Long COVID, focusing on actionable aspects for patients and their loved ones.

## Key Updates and Findings

*   **Prevalence:** Recent studies indicate approximately 6 in 100 *infected individuals* develop Long COVID. This is a decrease from earlier pandemic estimates, such as those from 2020-2022 which suggested a higher rate. However, each subsequent COVID-19 infection can *further increase* the cumulative risk of developing or worsening Long COVID.
*   **Symptoms:** Common symptoms include:
    *   Fatigue
    *   Breathlessness
    *   Muscle and joint pain (myalgia and arthralgia)
    *   Impaired sleep (insomnia, fragmented sleep, changes in sleep patterns)
    *   Cognitive issues ("brain fog")
    *   **Symptom Clusters:** Dizziness, palpitations, light-headedness on standing (related to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)), and exercise intolerance, or post-exertional malaise (PEM) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) often appear together. *Individuals may experience other combinations of symptoms.*
*   **Impact:** Long COVID can affect work, income, and quality of life.
*   **Recovery:** Symptoms generally improve over 4-9 months for many individuals, but it's important to understand that recovery is not always linear or complete. Some people continue to experience symptoms beyond 12 months, and some may experience relapses or fluctuations in symptom severity over longer periods.
*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   Children with obesity are more likely to develop Long COVID.
    *   Children in areas with poorer access to healthcare are more likely to develop lung or neurological symptoms of Long COVID.
    *   Vaccination is highly effective at preventing severe acute COVID-19 and may reduce the risk of Long COVID, but breakthrough infections can still lead to Long COVID.
*   **Eye Health:** Long COVID patients experienced reduced blood vessel density in the *retina*; long-term vision consequences are being studied.

## Management and Support

*   **Self-Management:**
    *   Quality rest/sleep
    *   Energy conservation (pacing, prioritizing tasks, assistive devices)
    *   Flare-up strategies (identify triggers, reduce activity, monitor symptoms). Keep a symptom journal to track progress and patterns.
    *   *Discuss these self-management strategies with your healthcare provider to create a personalized plan.*
*   **Multidisciplinary Programs:** Advocate for equitable access to multidisciplinary Long COVID programs.
    *   *Advocate for access to multidisciplinary Long COVID programs by discussing this need with your healthcare providers and local health authorities.*
*   **Symptomatic Relief:** Doctors may offer medications for symptom relief and address new medical problems post-COVID-19.
*   **Individualized Treatment:** Treatment should be individualized.
*   **Rehabilitation:** Personalized cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is being tested for exercise intolerance. Structured pacing is being tested for PEM.
*   **Support Resources:** Support groups and resources are available online and through some hospital systems. Examples include online patient communities and national Long COVID organizations. You can also search for "Long COVID support groups" in your region or online.

## The Role of Blood Work and Biomarkers

*   **Limitations of Routine Tests:** Routine blood tests (e.g., complete blood count, metabolic panel, inflammatory markers like CRP or ESR), chest X-rays, and electrocardiograms may be normal in Long COVID.
*   **Need for Novel Biomarkers:** Research is focusing on identifying novel biomarkers through transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), and metabolomics (metabolites).
*   **Blood Protein Signature in Children:** Studies have identified pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenetic protein markers in children with Long COVID (currently in research stages).
*   **RNA Transcripts as Biomarkers:** SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts have been found in the blood cells of people with Long COVID, suggesting ongoing viral replication.
*   **Link to Brain Proteins:** COVID-19 has been linked to increased levels of biomarkers associated with faulty amyloid proteins in the brain.
*   **Important Note:** 25 common blood tests couldn't serve as reliable biomarkers for Long COVID.

*What to track and share with your healthcare provider:*

*   *Symptom Severity*: Track daily symptom severity on a scale of 1-10.
*   *Activity Levels*: How much physical and mental activity can you tolerate daily?
*   *Heart Rate Variability (HRV)*: Track your HRV - some wearable devices can now track this. A lower HRV indicates higher stress.
*   *Sleep Quality*: Use a sleep tracker to monitor sleep duration and quality.

## Potential Treatments and Ongoing Research

*   **Treating Viral Reservoirs:** Research is exploring interventions to clear persistent SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs.
    *   **Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs):** Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are being investigated for Long COVID, but it's crucial to understand that these are *different* from the mAbs used to treat acute COVID-19. These Long COVID mAbs are currently *investigational* and are *not FDA-approved* for this condition. Research is exploring their potential to neutralize persistent virus or modulate the immune system. As with any antibody treatment, potential side effects, such as infusion reactions or allergic reactions, are possible.
        *   *Discuss this research and any potential treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine if they are appropriate for your specific situation.*
    *   **Antivirals:** Antivirals, including extended courses of drugs like Paxlovid, are being explored because longer treatment durations may be necessary to eradicate persistent virus. However, it is critical to note that *extended use of Paxlovid for Long COVID is not currently FDA-approved* and remains *investigational*. Paxlovid also has potential side effects, including rebound symptoms after completing the course, and significant drug interactions. Patients should have a thorough discussion with their healthcare provider to weigh the potential benefits against the known and unknown risks of extended Paxlovid use in the context of Long COVID.
        *   *Discuss this research and any potential treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine if they are appropriate for your specific situation.*
    *   **Immunotherapies:** Immunotherapies, such as interferon or other immunomodulators that aim to rebalance the immune system, are under investigation for Long COVID. These approaches are currently *investigational* and are *not yet standard treatments*. Immunomodulatory therapies can carry risks, including potentially increasing susceptibility to infections or triggering autoimmune responses, and their use in Long COVID requires careful evaluation within clinical trials.
        *   *Discuss this research and any potential treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine if they are appropriate for your specific situation.*
    *   **Viral RNA Targeting:** Viral RNA Targeting, including *very early-stage research* into innovative approaches like CRISPR-based treatments, holds theoretical promise to deactivate persistent viral RNA. It is crucial to understand that this research is highly preliminary and is not currently available or ready for clinical application.
        *   *Discuss this research and any potential treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine if they are appropriate for your specific situation.*
*   **Immunomodulators: Baricitinib:** Baricitinib, an FDA-approved drug *for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and alopecia areata*, is being investigated for its potential to reverse the effects of Long COVID. *It is important to emphasize that Baricitinib is not yet FDA-approved for Long COVID*. Like all medications, Baricitinib has potential side effects, most notably an increased risk of infections. Patients should have a detailed discussion with their healthcare provider to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks in their individual situation before considering Baricitinib for Long COVID.
        *   *Discuss this research and any potential treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine if they are appropriate for your specific situation.*
*   **Paxlovid:** Extended use of the antiviral Paxlovid *beyond the standard acute COVID-19 treatment duration* has shown promise *in research studies* for Long COVID. *Similar to Baricitinib, Paxlovid is not FDA-approved for Long COVID in extended courses and has potential side effects, including rebound symptoms, drug interactions, and others. Consultation with a healthcare provider is essential.*
        *   *Discuss this research and any potential treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine if they are appropriate for your specific situation.*

## Important Considerations

*   **Long COVID is Heterogeneous:** Long COVID presents differently in everyone.
*   **Reinfection Risk:** Each new SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of developing Long COVID. Preventive measures (masks, hygiene, ventilation) and vaccination remain important.
*   **Misconceptions:** Dispelling misconceptions about Long COVID is key to proper diagnosis, treatment, and patient support.
*   **Advocacy:** Collective effort is needed to reduce reinfection risk and support those living with Long COVID.

This information should empower patients and their families to advocate for appropriate care, understand the complexities of Long COVID, and stay informed about emerging research and potential treatments.
