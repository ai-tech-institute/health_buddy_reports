# Understanding Long COVID (May 2025)

Here's what we know about Long COVID as of May 2025, focusing on actionable information for you and your loved ones.

**What is Long COVID? Multiple "Types" of Illness**

*   **More Than Lingering Symptoms:** Long COVID is likely several related conditions ("endotypes") following a COVID-19 infection. Identifying *your* type could lead to better treatments.
*   **Wide Range of Symptoms:** Over 200 symptoms are reported, affecting many body systems:
    *   **Neurological:** Headaches, brain fog (difficulty concentrating, memory issues), sleep problems, internal tremors.
    *   **Cardiovascular/Autonomic:** POTS (rapid heart rate upon standing, causing dizziness).
    *   **Respiratory:** Breathlessness.
    *   **Musculoskeletal:** Fatigue, muscle/joint pain.
    *   **Other:** Altered taste, hormonal changes, post-exertional malaise (PEM - symptom worsening after activity). **Action:** *Pace yourself to avoid PEM triggers. Pacing involves balancing activity and rest, staying within your "energy envelope." Consider guidance from an occupational or physical therapist.*
    *   **Important:** Symptoms often overlap, fluctuate in severity, and change over time.
*   **Cognitive Effects:** Studies suggest COVID-19 can affect memory, attention, and planning. Effects vary widely. **Action:** *Cognitive rehabilitation exercises can help. These often involve targeted exercises for memory, attention, and executive function, guided by specialists such as occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, or neuropsychologists.*
*   **Who's at Risk:** Children with obesity, those with limited healthcare access, and adults with pre-existing conditions (diabetes, autoimmune disorders) are at higher risk. Each reinfection increases your risk. **Action:** *Vaccination reduces the risk of developing Long COVID.*
*   **Severity Doesn't Always Matter:** Long COVID can occur even after mild initial COVID-19 infection.

**How is Long COVID Diagnosed?**

*   **No Single Test:** Diagnosis relies on your health history, physical exam, and reported symptoms. Normal routine tests don't rule out Long COVID.
*   **Seeking a Diagnosis:**
    *   Start with your primary care physician.
    *   Consider seeking care from doctors or specialized clinics experienced with Long COVID, if available.
    *   Doctors may order tests to investigate specific symptoms (e.g., tilt table test for POTS, pulmonary function tests for breathlessness) or rule out other conditions.
*   **Biomarkers in Research:** Researchers are seeking biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.
    *   **Attomarker Blood Test (Research):** Categorizes immune responses. Not yet FDA-approved (May 2025).
    *   **RNA Transcripts (Research):** Detects viral genetic material, suggesting possible ongoing viral presence. Not a standard clinical test (May 2025).
    *   **Other Biomarkers Under Investigation:** Inflammatory markers (cytokines), autoantibodies, markers of gut microbiome changes, markers of tissue damage.
*   **Understanding "Endotypes":** Researchers are investigating potential Long COVID categories: Persistent viral activity, dysautonomia (POTS), autoimmune reactions, chronic inflammation, microclots, and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). These are research areas, not definitive diagnoses.

**Current Management Strategies**

*   **Non-Pharmacological:**
    *   Tailored Physical Therapy: Gentle exercise programs, mindful of PEM.
    *   Occupational Therapy: Energy conservation techniques and activity adaptation.
    *   Sleep Hygiene: Establishing regular sleep schedules and optimizing sleep environment.
    *   Nutritional Considerations: Anti-inflammatory diets.
    *   Mental Health Support: Counseling for anxiety, depression, and trauma related to chronic illness.
    *   Specific Symptom Management: Hydration and salt intake for POTS, breathing exercises for breathlessness.
*   **Medical Management:** Healthcare providers may also prescribe symptom-specific medications (e.g., for POTS, sleep disturbances, pain, anxiety, depression) as part of a comprehensive management plan.

**Emerging Treatments and Research: What's Being Studied?**

*   **Focus on Root Causes:** Persistent virus, autoimmune issues, tissue damage, and reactivation of other viruses are being investigated.
*   **Clinical Trials: *All medications listed below are investigational for Long COVID and not yet approved treatments.* Contact your doctor and check ClinicalTrials.gov for details, eligibility criteria, and potential side effects.**
    *   **Typical Eligibility Criteria (Examples):** Confirmed prior COVID-19 infection, specific Long COVID symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, breathlessness), symptoms lasting 3+ months, specific age range, absence of other medical conditions.
    *   **AER002 (Long-acting human immunoglobulin):** Phase 2/3. Neutralizes spike protein. Broad symptom target. *See ClinicalTrials.gov for details.*
    *   **Baricitinib (Immunomodulatory drug):** Phase 3 (REVERSE-LC Trial). Reduces inflammation. Improves neurocognitive/physical function. *(FDA-approved for other conditions). See ClinicalTrials.gov for details.*
    *   **Polymerized type I collagen (Immunomodulatory drug):** Phase 2. Downregulates inflammation. *See ClinicalTrials.gov for details.*
    *   **Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid):** Studies show mixed results. *See ClinicalTrials.gov for details.*
    *   **Upadacitinib and Pirfenidone (Anti-inflammatory medicines):** Global clinical trial. Reduce inflammation. *(FDA-approved for other conditions). See ClinicalTrials.gov for details.*
    *   **WEHI-P8 Compound:** Preclinical (mice only). Targets viral enzyme. *Not in human trials. "Preclinical (mice only)" means it is currently being studied in laboratories or animal models and has not yet advanced to testing in humans.*

**Support and Awareness: You Are Not Alone**

*   **Long COVID Awareness Day:** March 15th.
*   **Community Support:** Long COVID Support Strategy 2025 emphasizes community-driven change and research.
*   **Online Communities:** Online support groups are available.
*   **Vaccination:** COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk or severity of Long COVID following infection.

**Important Considerations**

*   **NIH Research Funding:** Advocate for continued research funding.
*   **Address Misconceptions:** Share reliable information (CDC, NIH, patient groups) and advocate for yourself.
*   **Cyclical Symptoms:** Track symptom severity in a diary. Use questionnaires designed for fluctuating conditions. This will help your doctor understand your experience.

*Consult your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.*
