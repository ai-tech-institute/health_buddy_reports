## Multiple Myeloma: Recent Advances and Key Information for Patients & Families

This summary highlights key advances in multiple myeloma, focusing on actionable information for patients and families. **Discuss all information with your healthcare team to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.**

### 1. New Treatment Approaches & Approvals

**Clinical trials are crucial for advancing myeloma treatment. Discuss with your doctor if participating in a clinical trial is a suitable option for you at any stage of your disease.**

*   **Quadruplet Therapy (VRd):** For newly diagnosed patients eligible for autologous stem cell transplant, the VRd regimen (daratumumab plus lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone) is frequently used as a standard first-line treatment, leading to deeper and longer-lasting remissions.
    *   **VRd Explained:** Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug. Dexamethasone is a steroid.
    *   **Important:** Side effects can include fatigue, nausea, neuropathy, and low blood counts. **Talk to your doctor about managing potential side effects.**

*   **Monoclonal Antibodies:** These drugs target specific proteins on myeloma cells.
    *   **Daratumumab (Darzalex):** Daratumumab is an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody (approved in 2015). It targets the CD38 protein. Common side effects can include infusion reactions, fatigue, nausea, low blood counts, and infections. It is approved for both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory settings.

*   **Isatuximab (Sarclisa):** Isatuximab (Sarclisa) is FDA-approved (approved in 2020) for use in combination with VRd for patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma after one to three prior treatment regimens and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. **Discuss with your doctor if Isatuximab is right for you.**

*   **CAR T-cell Therapies (Abecma & Carvykti):** CAR T-cell therapies like idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma, FDA-approved in 2021) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti, FDA-approved in 2022) are FDA-approved treatment options for patients with myeloma that has returned or not responded to multiple prior lines of therapy, typically including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies.
    *   **Important:** Potential significant side effects include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS). These are serious but carefully monitored and managed by specialized medical teams. **Talk to your doctor about if CAR-T therapy is an option for you, and what to expect.**

*   **Bispecific Antibodies (Teclistamab - Tecvayli™):** Bispecific antibodies, like Teclistamab (Tecvayli™, FDA-approved in 2022), are a treatment option for patients with myeloma that has relapsed or is refractory after at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.
    *   **Important:** Common and potentially serious side effects include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, and infections. Treatment with Teclistamab is typically administered at specialized centers where side effects can be carefully monitored and managed.

*   **Treating Smoldering Myeloma:** The use of daratumumab for smoldering myeloma is currently investigational and not FDA-approved outside of clinical trials. **Patients interested in this approach should discuss clinical trial options with their doctors.**

*   **Autologous stem cell transplant** remains a cornerstone of treatment for many eligible patients, typically performed after initial induction therapy.

### 2. Understanding Prognosis and Risk

*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD):** Achieving MRD negativity is a key indicator of treatment response and is linked to improved outcomes. **Ask your doctor how MRD testing can inform your treatment plan.**
*   **Risk Stratification:** The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) and genetic abnormalities are used to assess risk and guide treatment decisions.
*   **Genetic Abnormalities:** Genetic testing (cytogenetics and FISH) is a standard part of myeloma diagnosis. Gain or amplification of 1q21 and the translocation t(11;14) are considered higher-risk features associated with faster disease progression or resistance to certain treatments.
*   **Time to Progression (TTP):** How long you stay in remission after initial treatment impacts overall survival.

### 3. Symptoms and Diagnosis

*   **Revised Diagnostic Criteria:** Diagnosis now includes 'SLiM-CRAB' features, allowing for earlier detection.
    *   'SLiM' refers to biomarkers like:
        *   S60 (≥60% clonal plasma cells in bone marrow)
        *   Light chain ratio ≥100
        *   MRI with more than one focal lesion
    *   These, along with the traditional CRAB criteria (hyperCalcemia, Renal insufficiency, Anemia, Bone lesions), help in earlier diagnosis.
*   **Importance of Early Detection:** Early detection is key to preventing long-term damage.

### 4. Interpreting Blood Work & Reports

Regular blood work is essential to monitor your myeloma and treatment response. **Always discuss your blood work results with your doctor.** Normal ranges can vary slightly between labs.

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets. Typical normal ranges vary by lab, but generally are approximately: RBC (women: 4.2-5.4 million/µL, men: 4.7-6.1 million/µL), WBC (4,500-11,000/µL), Platelets (150,000-450,000/µL). **Always refer to your lab report's reference range.** Monitored frequently.
*   **Hemoglobin:** A protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Low hemoglobin is a sign of anemia. (Normal range is roughly around 12-16 g/dL for women and 13.5-17.5 g/dL for men, **but this varies significantly by lab - always refer to your lab report's reference range**). Monitored frequently.
*   **Blood Chemistry:** Measures BUN, creatinine, albumin, calcium, and electrolytes. Monitored frequently.
    *   BUN and creatinine indicate kidney function.
    *   High calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause fatigue and confusion.
*   **LDH and Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):** High levels suggest more advanced disease. Monitored during diagnosis and treatment.
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Identifies M protein in the blood. Monitored frequently to check the treatment efficacy.
*   **Serum Free Light Chain Test:** Measures kappa and lambda light chains. Monitored during diagnosis and treatment.
*   **M Spike:** A marker of myeloma activity. Monitoring it is crucial to assess treatment response and disease progression. Monitored frequently to check the treatment efficacy.

### 6. Other Important Points

*   **Racial Disparities:** Black people are more likely to develop and die from multiple myeloma.
*   **Importance of Clinical Trials:** Participation from diverse communities in clinical trials is crucial.
*   **Personalized Treatment:** Myeloma treatment is not "one-size-fits-all".
*   **Palliative Radiotherapy (RT):** Remains important for managing symptoms like pain and preventing fractures.
