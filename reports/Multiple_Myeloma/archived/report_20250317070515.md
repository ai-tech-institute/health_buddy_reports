# Understanding Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families

This summary provides an overview of recent advances and practical knowledge about Multiple Myeloma.

## 1. Treatment Advances: New Options & What They Mean

*   **Quadruplet Regimens:** Using four drugs (quadruplet regimens) for newly diagnosed myeloma patients, even those eligible for transplant, is a significant advancement. Daratumumab plus VRd (lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone) is now a preferred regimen. The GRIFFIN trial demonstrated the benefit of adding Daratumumab to VRd, showing improved response rates and deeper remissions compared to VRd alone. These regimens aim for deeper and more durable responses, potentially increasing the chances of achieving MRD negativity. Typically, induction therapy with quadruplet regimens may last for approximately 6-9 cycles (months), followed by consideration of stem cell transplant and/or maintenance therapy. Treatment cycles are often 28 days, with VRd typically given in 21 or 28-day cycles. Daratumumab is often administered weekly initially, then bi-weekly, and eventually monthly as maintenance, either intravenously or subcutaneously.

*   **Monoclonal Antibodies:**
    *   **Daratumumab (Darzalex and Darzalex Faspro):** Continues to be a key drug in combination therapies. Daratumumab is often administered weekly initially, then bi-weekly, and eventually monthly as maintenance. Daratumumab is generally well-tolerated but can cause infusion reactions, especially during the first infusion. The injectable form, Darzalex Faspro, reduces infusion time.
    *   **Isatuximab (Sarclisa):** Isatuximab, in combination with VRd, is approved for patients with multiple myeloma who are *not eligible for* stem cell transplant. Isatuximab, administered via intravenous infusion, was studied in the ICARIA-MM trial and is another option, also with potential infusion reactions and fatigue as side effects.
    *   *What to watch for:* Common side effects include infusion reactions (fever, chills, nausea), fatigue, increased risk of infections (bacterial, viral like upper respiratory infections, and fungal), and neutropenia (low white blood cell count).

*   **Bispecific Antibodies:**
    *   **Teclistamab (Tecvayli™):** A BCMA-directed bispecific antibody, given as a subcutaneous injection, was FDA-approved in 2022 for patients whose myeloma has relapsed or is refractory to other treatments. Teclistamab is typically given weekly initially, with step-up dosing to minimize CRS risk, and then may transition to less frequent dosing based on response and tolerability. As a bispecific antibody, it can cause side effects like Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which can feel like flu symptoms, and less commonly, Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), affecting the nervous system. While CRS and ICANS are serious potential side effects, they are generally manageable with supportive care in experienced centers, and treatment protocols are in place to monitor and mitigate these risks. These are monitored closely by the treatment team.

*   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** CAR T-cell therapy is another innovative approach for *relapsed or refractory* myeloma where a patient's own immune cells are collected through a process called apheresis, modified to target myeloma cells, and then infused back into the patient. The process from apheresis to CAR T-cell infusion typically takes several weeks, during which bridging therapy may be needed to control the myeloma. FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies like idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti) are available. Like bispecific antibodies, CAR T-cell therapy can cause CRS and ICANS, requiring administration and close monitoring at specialized treatment centers experienced in managing CAR T-cell therapy due to the risk of CRS and ICANS.

*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD):**
    *   Assessing MRD status is increasingly important. MRD is usually measured through a bone marrow test using very sensitive techniques like Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or multiparameter flow cytometry to detect any remaining myeloma cells. Achieving MRD negativity is a very positive sign, meaning there is no detectable myeloma after treatment, and this is linked to longer periods without the myeloma returning. While MRD negativity is a strong positive indicator, it's important to understand that achieving MRD negativity doesn't guarantee a cure, and some patients may still experience relapse. Conversely, patients who do not achieve MRD negativity can still have meaningful and durable responses to treatment. Achieving MRD negativity is a major treatment goal as it is associated with longer remissions and better outcomes.

*   **Smoldering Myeloma Treatment:** Daratumumab is also showing promise in treating high-risk smoldering myeloma, which is an early stage of myeloma with a higher chance of progressing to active myeloma. It is crucial to understand that not all patients with smoldering myeloma require immediate treatment. Treatment with Daratumumab in this setting is typically considered only for *high-risk* smoldering myeloma to delay progression to active myeloma. Low-risk smoldering myeloma is often monitored without immediate therapy. High-risk smoldering myeloma is often defined by factors like the percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow and levels of M-protein and free light chains, often using the "20-2-20" risk criteria (≥20% bone marrow plasma cells, serum M-protein ≥2 g/dL, and involved-to-uninvolved free light chain ratio ≥20).

## 2. Understanding Your Blood Work & Reports: Key Indicators

*   **M Protein (M Spike):**
    *   These are abnormal antibodies produced by myeloma cells, detected by Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP) and Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP) tests. An "M spike" indicates elevated levels. The type of M-protein (like IgG, IgA, etc.) is also important and will be specified in your lab report. There isn't a "normal" range; its presence is generally abnormal. An M protein level ≥30 grams per liter (g/L), along with other symptoms, can indicate multiple myeloma.
       It's important to note that having an M-protein doesn't always mean myeloma. Many people have a condition called MGUS (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance), where a small amount of M-protein is present, but it's *not cancerous* but is a precursor condition that carries a small risk of progressing to myeloma or other plasma cell disorders. Regular monitoring is essential for those with MGUS to detect any progression early.
*   **Serum Free Light Chain Assay:**
    *   Measures kappa and lambda light chains (components of antibodies). An abnormal kappa to lambda *ratio* is a key indicator. The ratio, along with the absolute levels of free light chains measured in units like "mg/L" or "g/L", helps in diagnosis and monitoring. Higher levels and a more skewed ratio can sometimes suggest more aggressive disease.

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   Measures red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Myeloma cells can crowd out normal blood cells, leading to low blood counts (anemia is common).

*   **Blood Chemistry Profile:**
    *   Assesses kidney and liver function, calcium levels, and other electrolytes. Abnormalities can indicate organ damage from myeloma.

*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulins:**
    *   Measures levels of different types of antibodies (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM). In myeloma, one type of immunoglobulin is often elevated while others are low.

*   **LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase):** Elevated levels may indicate aggressive myeloma, but this test is non-specific.

## 3. Symptoms, Diagnosis & the CRAB Criteria

*   Symptoms can include bone pain, fatigue, frequent infections, and kidney problems. However, early myeloma may have no symptoms.
*   Diagnosis involves blood and urine tests, bone marrow biopsy, and imaging (X-rays, MRI, CT, PET scans).
*   Diagnostic criteria include either a plasma cell tumor or at least 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, *and* one or more of the following: high blood calcium, poor kidney function, anemia, bone lesions, or increased light chains in the blood. These criteria are often remembered by the acronym CRAB:
    *   **C**alcium elevation (Hypercalcemia)
    *   **R**enal insufficiency (Kidney problems)
    *   **A**nemia (Low red blood cell count)
    *   **B**one lesions (Bone damage)

## 4. Risk Factors and Disparities

*   Black people and older adults have a significantly higher incidence of multiple myeloma compared to white people. Family history of myeloma or other plasma cell disorders is also a risk factor, though less strong. The reasons for the disparity in Black people are complex and may involve genetic factors, socioeconomic factors, and differences in access to healthcare. Research is ongoing to better understand and address these disparities.

## 5. Support and Resources

*   The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS): Offers financial assistance, patient education materials, and support groups.
*   HealthWell Foundation: Provides financial assistance to help with medication co-pays and other treatment-related costs.
*   CancerCare: Offers free professional counseling, support groups, and practical help.
*   The International Myeloma Foundation (IMF): Provides comprehensive education for patients and caregivers, advocates for research, and supports a global myeloma community.
*   Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF): Focuses on accelerating myeloma research and offers resources like a clinical trial finder.
*   Virtual support groups exist for myeloma patients and caregivers, including those with young children.

## 6. Other Key Points

*   Multiple myeloma is currently considered incurable, but treatments can effectively manage the disease for years.
*   Maintenance therapy is common after stem cell transplant or other treatments to prolong remission.
*   Consider discussing clinical trial options with your healthcare team *at diagnosis and throughout your myeloma journey*. Clinical trials are vital for progress and may offer access to cutting-edge treatments, even for newly diagnosed patients. Patients interested in exploring clinical trials can ask their doctor or use online resources like clinicaltrials.gov or the MMRF Clinical Trial Finder.
*   A 24-hour urine test may no longer be necessary for response criteria in clinical trials.
