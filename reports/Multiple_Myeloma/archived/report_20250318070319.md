# Understanding the Latest in Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families

This summary highlights key updates in multiple myeloma research to empower patients and their loved ones.

## Myeloma Symptoms & Diagnosis (Updated October 2024)

Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial. Talk to your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Myeloma diagnosis is complex and requires evaluation by a hematologist/oncologist.

*   **Revised Diagnostic Criteria:** According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), diagnosis requires *either* a biopsy-proven plasma cell tumor *or* at least 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, *AND* **at least one of the CRAB criteria OR at least one of the Biomarkers of Malignancy.**
    *   **CRAB Criteria:**
        *   **C**alcium: High blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia). Myeloma can cause bone breakdown, releasing calcium into the blood.
        *   **R**enal: Poor kidney function. Myeloma cells can produce proteins that damage the kidneys, leading to impaired function. BUN and Creatinine are monitored to assess kidney function and detect potential myeloma-related kidney problems.
        *   **A**nemia: Low red blood cell count. Myeloma cells can crowd out normal blood-forming cells in the bone marrow, leading to anemia.
        *   **B**one: Bone lesions (holes) on imaging (X-rays, CT scans, MRI, PET/CT scans). Myeloma cells can create areas of bone destruction.
    *   **Biomarkers of Malignancy:**
        *   Abnormal Serum Free Light Chain Ratio: An abnormal ratio of kappa to lambda free light chains in the blood, reflecting overproduction of one type of light chain by myeloma cells. The normal ratio is typically around 0.26-1.65, *but this range can vary between labs*. **Always discuss your specific lab results and the reference range used by your lab with your doctor.**
        *   60% or More Plasma Cells in the Bone Marrow: Indicating a high degree of bone marrow involvement by myeloma cells.

*   **Importance of Electrophoresis:** Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) measures antibodies in the blood and can detect abnormal monoclonal antibodies (M protein, M spike, or paraprotein) produced by myeloma cells. If SPEP detects an M-protein, Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE) is typically performed to confirm and characterize the monoclonal protein. This is crucial for identifying the specific type of abnormal antibody (M-protein) produced by myeloma cells, which helps in diagnosis, monitoring disease, and assessing treatment response.

*   **Understanding Blood Work:** Your doctor will order these blood tests regularly to monitor your myeloma and how well your treatment is working. Discuss your blood test results with your healthcare team to understand their implications for your condition and treatment plan.
    *   **BUN and Creatinine:** Indicate kidney function. Myeloma can damage the kidneys.
    *   **Albumin:** Low albumin levels can be seen in myeloma and may reflect the disease burden or nutritional status.
    *   **Calcium:** High levels (hypercalcemia) can cause fatigue, weakness, and confusion.
    *   **LDH and Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):** These are prognostic markers, meaning higher levels *may* be associated with more aggressive disease or a less favorable prognosis. These are *part* of the overall picture.
    *   **Serum Free Light Chains:** Measures light chain levels in the blood, helpful when SPEP doesn't detect M protein. This is especially important in light chain myeloma, a subtype where SPEP might not detect the abnormal protein, but free light chain assays can.
*   **Imaging Modalities:**
    *   X-rays are often the first imaging test to look for bone damage (lytic lesions).
    *   CT scans provide more detailed images of bones and soft tissues.
    *   MRI is excellent for visualizing bone marrow and detecting spinal cord compression or soft tissue involvement.
    *   PET/CT scans can identify metabolically active myeloma cells throughout the body and are useful for assessing treatment response and detecting myeloma outside the bone marrow (extramedullary disease).

## Myeloma Treatment Advancements (Updated October 2024)

Significant progress has been made in myeloma treatment. Discuss these options with your doctor to determine the best approach for you.

*   **Quadruplet Regimens: A New Standard of Care:** Quadruplet regimens, combining four drugs, are increasingly becoming the new standard of care for treating newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients. These regimens are more effective than older triplet therapies because they attack myeloma cells in multiple ways simultaneously, leading to deeper and longer-lasting remissions. A common example is Dara-VRd, which includes daratumumab (Darzalex, a monoclonal antibody), bortezomib (Velcade, a proteasome inhibitor), lenalidomide (Revlimid, an immunomodulatory drug), and dexamethasone (a steroid). Other combinations exist, and your doctor will determine the most appropriate quadruplet regimen based on your individual situation. **Discuss with your doctor if a quadruplet regimen is right for you as a first-line treatment.**

*   **Immunotherapy Integration:** Immunotherapy is now a key part of treating relapsed/refractory myeloma. CAR T-cell therapies, such as Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti) and Idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma), are being recommended earlier in treatment for high-risk, relapsed patients. These therapies are typically considered for patients who have relapsed after or are resistant to standard treatments after several prior lines of therapy. CAR T-cell therapy involves collecting your own T-cells, genetically modifying them in a lab to target myeloma cells, and then infusing them back into your body. It is a complex treatment performed at **specialized centers** with experience in managing the unique side effects. CAR T-cell therapy can cause side effects like cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. CRS is an overreaction of the immune system causing flu-like symptoms, while neurotoxicity can affect the nervous system. These side effects are *serious but manageable* with close monitoring and treatments provided by specialized medical teams experienced in CAR T-cell therapy. **Ask your doctor if you are eligible for CAR T-cell therapy.**

*   **Monoclonal Antibody Therapies:** Daratumumab (Darzalex) has significantly changed myeloma treatment by targeting CD38, a protein highly expressed on myeloma cells, leading to their destruction by the immune system. Adding daratumumab to standard drug combinations makes the treatment more effective, reducing the risk of disease progression or death. Other important monoclonal antibodies include Elotuzumab (Empliciti), which targets SLAMF7, another protein found on myeloma cells, enhancing the immune system's ability to kill myeloma cells, and Isatuximab (Sarclisa), which also targets CD38, similar to daratumumab, but may have slightly different binding properties or be used in different combinations.

*   **Bispecific Antibodies:** A newer class of drugs. These antibodies work by attaching to myeloma cells on one end and immune cells (T-cells) on the other, bringing them together to allow the immune cells to destroy the myeloma cells. Teclistamab (Tecvayliâ„¢) was approved by the FDA in October 2022 and targets BCMA. Elranatamab (Elrexfio), targeting BCMA, received FDA approval in August 2023. Talquetamab (Talvey), targeting GPRC5D, was approved by the FDA in August 2023. Similar to CAR T-cell therapy, bispecific antibodies can have side effects like cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. These side effects are generally manageable with supportive care and treatments provided by healthcare professionals experienced in managing these therapies at specialized centers. Patients receiving bispecific antibodies are closely monitored for these side effects.

*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD):** Assessing MRD status is a sensitive way to evaluate a patient's response to treatment using highly sensitive tests like next-generation sequencing (NGS) or flow cytometry on bone marrow samples. Achieving MRD negativity often indicates a deeper remission and is associated with longer progression-free survival. While MRD negativity is a very positive sign associated with better outcomes, it's important to understand that it doesn't necessarily mean the myeloma is cured, but rather that it is in a very deep remission with a lower chance of relapse. Regular monitoring is still crucial even after achieving MRD negativity.

## Living with Myeloma (Updated October 2024)

Managing symptoms and maintaining well-being are important aspects of living with myeloma.

*   **Managing Symptoms:**
    *   **Bone Pain:** Can be managed with pain medications (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs, opioids, nerve pain medications like gabapentin/pregabalin), radiation therapy to specific bone lesions, and supportive measures (e.g., braces, physical therapy).
    *   **Kidney Problems:** Involves staying well-hydrated, avoiding NSAIDs (which can worsen kidney function in some cases), and dietary recommendations (should be *individualized and guided by a doctor or registered dietitian*), and in some cases, dialysis may be necessary.
    *   **Fatigue:** Can be addressed through regular gentle exercise, energy conservation techniques (e.g., pacing activities, prioritizing tasks, taking breaks), and addressing underlying issues like anemia (e.g., with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents if appropriate and under medical supervision). **Consider psychological support and counseling to address the emotional and mental health aspects of fatigue, as stress and anxiety can worsen fatigue. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness techniques may also be beneficial.**
    *   **Neuropathy (nerve damage causing tingling, numbness, pain in hands and feet):** Can be managed with medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Discuss with your doctor for appropriate management strategies.

*   **General Well-being:**
    *   Rest is important.
    *   Stay physically active to improve symptoms such as tiredness, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping.
    *   Drink lots of fluids to help your kidneys stay healthy.
    *   **Nutrition:** **Focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive saturated and unhealthy fats.** Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized dietary advice, especially if you have specific myeloma-related complications or treatment side effects. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.
    *   **Reduce your risk of infection:** Practice good hand hygiene, avoid close contact with sick people, get recommended vaccinations (like flu and pneumonia vaccines after consulting your doctor), and promptly report any signs of infection like fever to your healthcare team. Avoid crowds during flu season, consider wearing a mask in public places during peak respiratory virus times, ensure food safety, and practice good wound care. Promptly report any signs of infection, even mild ones, to your healthcare team as early treatment is crucial.

*   **Financial Support:** Several organizations offer financial assistance for multiple myeloma patients, for treatment costs, medications, transportation, and other expenses. Consider The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF), and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF). **Seek financial support from these organizations if needed.**

## Key Considerations

*   **Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities:** Diagnosis is often delayed in African American and Latino American patients due to factors beyond access to primary care, including socioeconomic factors, potential biases in healthcare systems, and differences in disease presentation. Advocacy efforts are crucial to address these disparities and ensure equitable access to diagnosis, treatment, and clinical trials for all myeloma patients. **Patients from underserved communities should proactively discuss any concerns about access to care or potential biases with their healthcare team and seek out patient advocacy organizations that focus on health equity. Support organizations working to reduce healthcare disparities in myeloma and advocate for equitable access to care.**

*   **Personalized Treatment:** Personalized treatment planning takes into account various factors such as genetic and cytogenetic risk factors, the extent of disease, the patient's overall health, frailty, comorbidities, and personal treatment goals. Genetic and cytogenetic testing of myeloma cells helps identify specific mutations and chromosomal abnormalities that can influence prognosis and treatment decisions. This information is increasingly used to tailor treatment strategies for individual patients. **Patients should actively engage in discussions with their doctors about their genetic and cytogenetic risk factors and how these factors inform their personalized treatment plan. Ask about the specific genetic tests performed on your myeloma cells and what the results mean for your prognosis and treatment choices.**

*   **Importance of Clinical Trials:** Clinical trials are crucial for developing better treatments and improving outcomes for myeloma patients. Consider participating in clinical trials to access cutting-edge treatments and contribute to research. Resources for finding clinical trials include clinicaltrials.gov and websites of myeloma patient advocacy groups like the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). Patient advocacy groups often have dedicated sections on their websites listing myeloma clinical trials and can provide support and information about trial participation. **Consider participating in clinical trials to access cutting-edge treatments and contribute to research.**
