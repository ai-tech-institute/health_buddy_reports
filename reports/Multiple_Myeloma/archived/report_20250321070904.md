# Understanding Multiple Myeloma: Key Updates and Resources for Patients & Families (2024-2025)

Here's a concise update on Multiple Myeloma, focusing on actionable information and support for patients and their families. While the incidence is increasing, multiple myeloma remains a relatively rare cancer.

## What's New in Myeloma?

*   **Incidence:** The incidence of multiple myeloma is increasing, largely due to the aging population and improved diagnostics leading to earlier detection.
*   **Treatment Progress:** Significant advancements, especially with antibody-based and cellular therapies, are leading to improved outcomes, with meaningful improvements in long-term survival and significant extension of survival in clinical trials.

### Key Treatment Updates

*   **Monoclonal Antibodies:**
    *   **Daratumumab (Darzalex®):** A monoclonal antibody that targets the CD38 protein on myeloma cells, commonly used in newly diagnosed patients and in relapsed/refractory settings. Often added to standard combinations to improve effectiveness.
    *   **Daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj (Darzalex Faspro):** A subcutaneous form of daratumumab that significantly reduces administration time and may decrease the need for prolonged clinic visits compared to IV Daratumumab.
    *   **Isatuximab-irfc (Sarclisa):** Another monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, used as a first-line treatment for transplant-ineligible patients (for patients who are not candidates for stem cell transplant due to age or other health conditions), typically combined with daratumumab and chemotherapy, or with Rd (lenalidomide and dexamethasone).
*   **Bispecific Antibodies:** FDA approved for relapsed or refractory myeloma *after multiple prior lines of therapy for patients who have tried and failed several prior lines of treatment*.
    *   **Teclistamab (Tecvayli™):** Targets BCMA. Approved based on the results of the MajesTEC-1 clinical trial. Given as a subcutaneous injection. Common side effects include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (ICANS), and infections. After the initial phase, the frequency reduces to bi-weekly or monthly after initial weekly dosing.
    *   **Talquetamab-tgvs (Talvey):** Targets GPRC5D. Given intravenously. Common side effects include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (ICANS), skin and nail toxicities, and taste changes.
    *   **Elranatamab-bcmm (Elrexfio):** Targets BCMA. Given as a subcutaneous injection. Common side effects include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (ICANS), and infections. After the initial phase, the frequency reduces to bi-weekly or monthly after initial weekly dosing.
        *   **Important:** While CRS and ICANS are potential risks with bispecific antibodies, they are generally manageable *in specialized centers with expertise in CAR T-cell and bispecific antibody therapy* through close monitoring and established protocols.
*   **CAR T-cell Therapies:** Currently approved CAR T-cell therapies, such as ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti) and idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma), target the BCMA protein on myeloma cells and are currently for relapsed/refractory myeloma after multiple lines of prior therapy. These have shown significant efficacy in relapsed/refractory disease. CAR T-cell therapy is a complex treatment requiring specialized centers, apheresis to collect T-cells, manufacturing of the CAR T-cells, and subsequent infusion, often involving a hospital stay and close monitoring. Response is typically evaluated within a few months after infusion.
    *   Newer trials target proteins like GPRC5D.
    *   Research suggests that treatments like bortezomib may enhance CAR T-cell therapy by making myeloma cells more susceptible to CAR T-cell attack or by improving CAR T-cell persistence in the body.
*   **Quadruplet Therapy:** Frontline treatment often involves combining four drug classes. A common example is Dara-VRd, which includes Daratumumab (monoclonal antibody), Bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor), Lenalidomide (immunomodulatory drug), and Dexamethasone (steroid). Regimens vary based on patient risk factors and transplant eligibility.

*Always discuss your individual situation and treatment options with your doctor.*

## What Matters Most to You

*   **Quality of Life:**
    *   **Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel - Carvykti):** Not only slows disease progression but also improves quality of life by reducing myeloma symptoms, improving function, and potentially reducing the need for continuous treatment.
*   **Personalized Treatment:** Work with your doctor to create a plan that balances effectiveness with your quality of life.
*   **Financial Support:** Organizations like [The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS)](www.lls.org), [HealthWell Foundation](www.healthwellfoundation.org), and [CancerCare](www.cancercare.org) offer co-pay assistance, travel grants, and support for medication costs.
*   **Caregiver Support:** Caregivers are also survivors and need support. The International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) offers support groups, educational materials, and information on respite care.

## Understanding Your Lab Results

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures blood cells. Low red blood cells (anemia) - *hemoglobin levels below normal range* is common in myeloma, leading to fatigue and weakness. Low white blood cells can increase infection risk, and low platelets can cause bleeding issues.
*   **Blood Chemistry Profile:** Checks kidney and liver function, and calcium levels. Myeloma can affect these organs. High calcium (hypercalcemia) - *calcium levels above the normal range* is a common complication causing symptoms like fatigue, confusion, and increased thirst.
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Identifies and measures M-protein, an abnormal protein produced by myeloma cells. M-spike on SPEP - *presence of an M-spike indicates an abnormal monoclonal protein* is used to diagnose and monitor treatment response.
*   **Serum Immunofixation (IFE):** Identifies the type of M protein and is used to diagnose and monitor treatment response.
*   **Serum-Free Light Chains:** Measures light chain proteins. Abnormal ratios - *an elevated kappa/lambda ratio or abnormal absolute levels indicate potential myeloma involvement* are a key indicator of myeloma and are monitored to assess disease activity.
*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):** High levels - *B2M levels above the normal range can suggest more advanced disease* can suggest a larger amount of myeloma in the body or more aggressive disease.
*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** Essential to confirm diagnosis. High percentage of plasma cells - *more than 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow is a diagnostic criterion for multiple myeloma* It shows the percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow, which is crucial for diagnosing myeloma and assessing its characteristics.

## Watch Out For These Symptoms

It is important to note that these symptoms are not exclusive to multiple myeloma and can be caused by other conditions. If you experience these symptoms, consult your doctor for proper diagnosis.

*   **Bone-related:**
    *   Bone pain: Persistent bone pain (back, ribs, hips) *that is new, worsening, or doesn't improve with rest*.
    *   Fractures
*   **Blood-related:**
    *   Fatigue: Unexplained and persistent fatigue *that is more severe than usual tiredness*.
    *   Shortness of breath
