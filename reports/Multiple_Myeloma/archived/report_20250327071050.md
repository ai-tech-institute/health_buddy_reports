            # Understanding Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

This summary provides the latest information on Multiple Myeloma to help patients and their loved ones understand the disease, its treatment, and how to navigate their journey.

## 1. What is Multiple Myeloma?

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell in your bone marrow. In myeloma, abnormal plasma cells grow too much, crowding out healthy blood cells and producing harmful proteins that can damage organs and weaken bones. Discuss any persistent or concerning symptoms with your doctor.

### Understanding the Symptoms

Symptoms of multiple myeloma can sometimes be mistaken for other common conditions, which can sometimes lead to delays in diagnosis. Symptoms can be categorized as follows:

*   **Bone Issues:**
    *   **Bone pain:** Especially in the spine or ribs, caused by bone damage from myeloma cells.
    *   Increased risk of bone fractures, even from minor injuries.
*   **Blood Issues:**
    *   **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired due to anemia or the activity of myeloma.
    *   **Unexplained weight loss.**
*   **Kidney Issues:**
    *   Kidney problems can manifest as swelling in legs, decreased urine output, or changes in urine color.
*   **Neurological Issues:**
    *   **Tingling in hands/feet (peripheral neuropathy).**
*   **Metabolic Issues:**
    *   **High calcium levels (hypercalcemia):** Can cause excessive thirst, frequent urination, confusion, and nausea.
    *   **Constipation.**
*   **Immune System Issues:**
    *   Increased susceptibility to infections like pneumonia, shingles, or urinary tract infections due to weakened immune system.

### Understanding CRAB Criteria

Doctors use the "CRAB" criteria to identify features of *symptomatic* myeloma that indicate organ damage and the need for treatment. These criteria are used to define symptomatic myeloma requiring treatment. Patients with Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM) do *not* meet CRAB criteria.

*   **C**alcium: Elevated calcium level in the blood because myeloma cells can damage bone tissue.
*   **R**enal: Kidney dysfunction because M proteins can damage the kidneys.
*   **A**nemia: Low red blood cell count.
*   **B**one: Bone involvement; myeloma cells can damage bone tissue leading to lesions and fractures.

### How is Myeloma Diagnosed?

Diagnosis involves blood, urine, bone marrow, and imaging tests.

*   **Blood tests:** Can detect M proteins (abnormal antibodies produced by myeloma cells) and beta-2-microglobulin (another protein that can be elevated in myeloma and helps doctors understand the extent of the disease).
*   **Urine tests:** Like blood tests, urine tests can also detect M proteins (Bence-Jones proteins). A 24-hour urine collection may be required.
*   **Bone marrow biopsy:** Determines if there are myeloma cells in your bone marrow and, if so, how many.
*   **Imaging tests:** Such as X-rays, MRI, or PET scans, are used to look for bone damage caused by myeloma.

### Staging Myeloma

Doctors use staging systems, such as the Revised International Staging System (RISS), to determine the extent and aggressiveness of the myeloma. Generally, lower stages (like Stage I) indicate less extensive disease and potentially better prognosis compared to higher stages (like Stage III). Staging helps determine prognosis and treatment intensity. Staging is based on factors like beta-2-microglobulin and albumin levels.

## 2. Treatment Advancements: What's New?

The five-year survival rate has increased due to more effective drugs. Discuss treatment options with your healthcare team.

### Daratumumab Combinations

Daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone is FDA-approved for newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma who are transplant-ineligible. A clinical trial in 2025 showed that adding daratumumab to a standard triplet therapy resulted in a 43% lower risk of disease progression or death in newly diagnosed patients not receiving a stem cell transplant as their initial treatment. Common side effects include infusion reactions, fatigue, and low blood counts.

**Important Considerations for Daratumumab Combinations:**

*   **Infusion Reactions:** Common symptoms include chills, fever, cough, and nausea. These are typically managed with premedications and by slowing the infusion rate.
*   **Hematologic Side Effects:** Neutropenia (low neutrophils) and thrombocytopenia (low platelets) are common.

### Bispecific Antibodies (Teclistamab)

Bispecific antibodies are a type of immunotherapy that helps your immune system find and destroy myeloma cells. Teclistamab (Tecvayliâ„¢) works by attaching to both myeloma cells and immune cells, bringing them together to fight the cancer. It was approved by the FDA in October 2022 for patients who have tried several types of standard treatments, such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and chemotherapy. Clinical trials have shown the cancer disappeared completely in nearly 40% of patients whose cancer had stopped responding to or progressed after at least three previous therapies.

Teclistamab is given as a subcutaneous injection, often starting with frequent doses and then less frequent once the disease is controlled.

Common side effects include:

*   **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):** Symptoms can include fever, chills, low blood pressure, and difficulty breathing. CRS is typically managed in the hospital with close monitoring and medications like tocilizumab. Onset is often within hours of infusion.
*   **Neurotoxicity (ICANS):** Symptoms can include confusion, tremors, and speech difficulties. ICANS also requires careful monitoring and management, typically in a hospital setting with neurological monitoring and steroids. Onset can be slightly later than CRS.
*   Infections.

**Important Considerations for Teclistamab:** These side effects are manageable with close monitoring and prompt intervention, typically in a hospital setting, especially during initial doses.

### CAR T-cell Therapy

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy where some of your own immune cells (T cells) are taken out, modified in a lab to recognize and attack myeloma cells, and then put back into your body. Specific examples of FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies for multiple myeloma include idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti). The typical patient journey for CAR T-cell therapy involves apheresis (collecting T cells), T-cell modification, and lymphodepleting chemotherapy before infusion.

It's typically used for relapsed/refractory myeloma after multiple prior treatments and is available at specialized centers with expertise in cell therapy and managing its side effects. Common side effects include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (ICANS), and low blood counts.

**Important Considerations for CAR T-cell Therapy:** Similar to bispecific antibodies, CRS and ICANS are potential side effects. Emphasize the specialized nature of CAR T-cell therapy, requiring treatment at centers with expertise in cell therapy and side effect management.

### Quad Therapies

Quadruplet therapies (e.g., daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (D-VRd)) are becoming the new standard of care for newly diagnosed patients because they have been shown to be more effective in achieving deeper and longer remissions compared to older treatment approaches.

### Maintenance Therapy

Maintenance therapy is treatment given after initial therapy to help keep the myeloma in remission for longer. Lenalidomide is a common single-agent maintenance therapy. Daratumumab + lenalidomide is a newer, more intensive option, often considered for high-risk patients or those who achieved deep responses.

### New Drug Approvals

Daratumumab is now available as Darzalex Faspro, a subcutaneous injection, which is faster and more convenient than intravenous infusion, reducing clinic visit time significantly and is approved for transplant-eligible AND transplant-ineligible patients. Daratumumab is now approved for transplant-eligible patients as part of induction therapy (before transplant) based on the PERSEUS trial. Isatuximab (Sarclisa) is approved for patients ineligible for stem cell transplants, often in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (IKd) in relapsed/refractory settings or with VRd in newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible patients based on trials like IKEMA for IKd and IMROZ for VRd.

### Treatment for High-Risk Smoldering Myeloma (SMM)

Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM) is a pre-myeloma condition where abnormal plasma cells are present but haven't yet caused organ damage. High-risk SMM means there's a higher chance of it progressing to active myeloma. Daratumumab for high-risk SMM is aimed at delaying or preventing progression to active myeloma, which could improve outcomes in the long run. Treatment for high-risk SMM is still evolving and often considered based on individual risk stratification.

## 3. Understanding Your Lab Results: What Do They Mean?

Here's a breakdown of common lab tests and their significance in managing myeloma:

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Low blood counts are common in myeloma because myeloma cells crowd out healthy blood-producing cells in the bone marrow. This can lead to anemia (low red blood cells), increasing fatigue; thrombocytopenia (low platelets), increasing bleeding risk; and leukopenia (low white blood cells), increasing infection risk.

    *   Normal ranges vary, but generally are: Red blood cells (e.g., 4.5-5.5 million/mcL), White blood cells (e.g., 4,500-11,000/mcL), Platelets (e.g., 150,000-450,000/mcL). Low values in myeloma are common.
*   **Blood Chemistry Profile:** Checks kidney and liver function, calcium levels, and other electrolytes.
    *   BUN and Creatinine: Measure kidney function. Elevated BUN and Creatinine indicate kidney dysfunction, which can be caused by myeloma and its treatments. *Example normal ranges: BUN (e.g., 7-20 mg/dL), Creatinine (e.g., 0.6-1.2 mg/dL). Elevated levels indicate potential kidney issues.*
    *   Albumin: A protein in the blood. Low albumin can sometimes be seen in myeloma and may be associated with more advanced disease or inflammation. *Example normal range: 3.4-5.4 g/dL.*
    *   Calcium: High calcium levels are part of the CRAB criteria and can be caused by myeloma damaging bones. *Example normal range: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL.*
    *   LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase): An enzyme that can be elevated in myeloma. Higher LDH levels may indicate faster-growing myeloma.
    *   Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M): A protein that is often elevated in myeloma and is used in staging and prognosis. Higher B2M levels are associated with more advanced stages of myeloma.
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Identifies M protein in the blood. The "M spike" is a sign of an abnormal protein (M protein) in your blood, which is produced by myeloma cells. It helps doctors track the amount of myeloma in your body. Monitoring M-protein levels is key to assess treatment response and detect relapse.
*   **Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP):** Myeloma cells can also produce abnormal proteins that can be found in the urine. UPEP helps measure these proteins.
*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulins:** Immunoglobulins are antibodies, and myeloma often causes an overproduction of one type and suppression of others, which can increase infection risk.
*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** A bone marrow biopsy is essential to confirm a diagnosis of myeloma and to see how many myeloma cells are present in the bone marrow. It helps doctors understand how active the myeloma is. Immunohistochemistry is a special test done on the bone marrow sample to help identify myeloma cells and understand their characteristics.
*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD):** Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) testing is a very sensitive test that looks for any myeloma cells that might be left in your body after treatment, even if standard tests don't find them. NGS-based MRD testing is a very advanced way to do this. Achieving MRD negativity means that the tests are not finding any myeloma cells at a very deep level of detection. This is a very good sign and is often associated with longer remissions but does not necessarily mean the myeloma is cured.

**Important Note:** These are just general ranges and individual labs may have slightly different ranges. Always discuss your lab results with your healthcare team.

## 4. Support and Awareness

*   **Myeloma Action Month:** March is Multiple Myeloma Action Month, focusing on raising awareness and supporting those affected.
*   **Support Groups:** Many support groups are available for patients and their families, both in-person and virtually. Ask your healthcare team or organizations like the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) (www.myeloma.org), the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) (www.themmrf.org), or the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) (www.lls.org) for resources to find local or virtual support groups. Prioritize groups affiliated with reputable myeloma organizations mentioned (IMF, MMRF, LLS) or recommended by your healthcare team. Verify the credibility and reliability of online support groups or resources you find independently.
    *   Virtual Support Groups (online meetings)
        *   Myeloma UK Friends and Family Support Group (virtual).
        *   Strength Through Inspiration: A Virtual Support Group for Multiple Myeloma Patients & Caregivers who have Young Children.
    *   In-Person Support Groups (local meetings)
        *   Leeds Myeloma Support Group (in-person).
        *   Garnet Health Multiple Myeloma Support Group.

## 5. Key Research Areas: The Future of Myeloma Treatment

*   **Targeting Changes Inside Myeloma Cells:** Researchers are studying specific gene mutations and protein abnormalities within myeloma cells to develop more targeted drugs that can attack these specific weaknesses.
*   **Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM):** Research is focused on identifying features of SMM that make it more likely to develop into active myeloma.
*   **Newer Treatments:** Clinical trials are exploring the use of T-cell engagers (TCEs) and CAR T-cell therapy earlier in the course of treatment. T-cell engagers are another type of immunotherapy that works by bringing T cells (immune cells) closer to myeloma cells to help the immune system destroy the cancer. TCEs are another form of bispecific antibody therapy, similar in principle to teclistamab but targeting different antigens on myeloma cells. Examples of TCEs include elranatamab or talquetamab. Emphasize that using CAR T-cell therapy and TCEs earlier in treatment is still being studied in clinical trials and is not yet standard practice, but shows promising future directions.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Remember that statistics reflect data from people who may not have had access to the newest treatments.
*   Individual prognosis depends on many factors, including disease stage, genetic risk factors, overall health, and response to treatment.
*   Early detection and personalized treatment approaches are crucial.
*   Discuss your individual prognosis and treatment options with your own oncologist, as myeloma care is highly personalized.
*   The rapid pace of research in myeloma means that new treatments are continually being developed and becoming available.
*   Consider seeking second opinions from myeloma specialists, especially at specialized myeloma centers or comprehensive cancer centers.
