# Understanding the Latest in Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families

This summary highlights recent advances in multiple myeloma (MM) treatment, symptom management, and supportive care, focusing on information that empowers patients and their loved ones.

## 1. New Treatment Options: What's Changing?

The treatment landscape for multiple myeloma is rapidly evolving. Most emerging therapies are investigational and available through clinical trials. Here's a breakdown of key advancements:

*   **Daratumumab Combinations:** Daratumumab (given intravenously or subcutaneously, depending on formulation) is often combined with other drugs like bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and dexamethasone (VRd). Adding daratumumab to VRd is FDA approved for the *treatment of newly diagnosed* multiple myeloma patients and has shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression or death. The subcutaneous formulation offers a more convenient and potentially faster administration compared to intravenous infusion. *What to track:* Monitor for infusion reactions (fever, chills), low blood cell counts, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and peripheral neuropathy. Report any unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately.
*   **Bispecific Antibodies (e.g., Teclistamab/Tecvayliâ„¢):** Teclistamab (given as a subcutaneous injection) is FDA approved for patients whose myeloma has returned or stopped responding after multiple prior treatments. These drugs work by attaching to both myeloma cells (via BCMA) and T-cells (via CD3), bringing them together to kill the myeloma cells. *Important considerations:* Due to the risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), which are more likely to occur during the initial doses, the first few doses of Teclistamab are administered in a hospital setting to allow for close monitoring and immediate management of these potential side effects. Your care team will monitor you closely. These drugs are part of a REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.
*   **CAR T-cell Therapy (e.g., Ciltacabtagene autoleucel/Carvykti, Idecabtagene vicleucel/Abecma):** For relapsed/refractory myeloma after multiple lines of treatment, a patient's own T-cells are removed, modified to target myeloma cells (specifically BCMA), and infused back. *Important considerations:* Requires treatment at specialized centers with expertise in managing potential side effects like CRS and ICANS. Close monitoring is involved.
*   **Quadruplet Therapy:** Quadruplet therapy (like D-VRd) is often considered for newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for transplant or those with high-risk disease features who may benefit from a more aggressive initial treatment to achieve deeper remission. However, it's not yet a standard approach for all newly diagnosed patients, and the best treatment strategy should be determined in consultation with your doctor based on individual factors.
*   **Isatuximab (Sarclisa):** Typically used in combination with other drugs like bortezomib and dexamethasone, carfilzomib and dexamethasone, or lenalidomide and dexamethasone, isatuximab (given intravenously) is FDA approved for relapsed/refractory myeloma.
*   **Venetoclax (Venclexta):** Venetoclax (Venclexta) is effective for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients who have a specific genetic abnormality called t(11;14) translocation. **It is crucial to undergo genetic testing to determine if your myeloma has this translocation before considering Venetoclax treatment, as its FDA approval is specifically for this patient population.**
*   **Emerging Therapies:**
    *   **Allogeneic CAR T-cell Products:** CAR T-cells from a healthy donor ("off-the-shelf"). Benefits: potentially faster access. Risks: Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD).
    *   **CAR T-cell Products Targeting Both GPRC5D and BCMA:** Designed to overcome resistance to existing CAR T-cell therapies.
    *   **CELMoDs (e.g., Iberdomide, Mezigdomide):** Work by modulating proteins involved in myeloma cell growth.
    *   **Belantamab Mafodotin (Blenrep):** **Belantamab Mafodotin (Blenrep) has been voluntarily withdrawn from the US market by the manufacturer.** It is currently under review based on new clinical trial data for potential re-approval. Discuss with your doctor for the most up-to-date information on its availability and potential use outside of the US, or if re-approval occurs.

## 2. Understanding Your Blood Work: What to Look For?

Regular blood tests are crucial for monitoring myeloma. Here's what key indicators mean:

*   **CRAB Criteria:** These help define active myeloma and assess organ damage:
    *   **Calcium (Elevated):** Myeloma cells break down bone, releasing calcium into the blood. *Track:* Your calcium levels in blood tests. *Why is it important to track this?* Elevated levels can cause various symptoms and indicate bone damage. *Action:* Discuss elevated calcium levels with your doctor.
    *   **Renal (Kidney Dysfunction):** Myeloma proteins can damage the kidneys. *Track:* BUN and creatinine levels in blood tests. *Why is it important to track this?* Monitoring kidney function helps detect early damage and prevent complications. *Action:* Discuss any changes in kidney function with your doctor.
    *   **Anemia (Low Red Blood Cell Count):** Myeloma cells crowd out normal blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. *Track:* Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in CBC. *Why is it important to track this?* Anemia can cause fatigue and weakness, impacting quality of life. *Action:* If you experience fatigue or weakness, discuss your hemoglobin levels with your doctor.
    *   **Bone (Bone Involvement):** Myeloma cells cause lesions in bones. *Track:* Bone pain, fractures. *Why is it important to track this?* Bone involvement can lead to pain and fractures, requiring management. *Action:* Report any new or worsening bone pain to your doctor.
*   **M Protein:** An abnormal protein produced by myeloma cells. *What it means:* High levels indicate active myeloma. Track this to monitor the disease. *Why is it important to track this?* Elevated levels are concerning and indicate active myeloma. *Action:* Discuss elevated levels with your doctor immediately to understand their significance and potential next steps.
*   **Serum Free Light Chains:** Detects myeloma even when M protein is negative. *What it means:* An important marker for monitoring treatment response. *Why is it important to track this?* It's a sensitive marker for detecting and monitoring myeloma.
*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulins:** Measures levels of different antibodies. *What it means:* Shows if myeloma is suppressing normal antibody production, increasing infection risk. *Why is it important to track this?* Low levels increase the risk of infection.
*   **Blood Chemistry Profile:** Checks kidney and liver function. *What it means:* Myeloma and its treatment can affect these organs. *Why is it important to track this?* Myeloma and its treatment can affect these organs
*   **BUN and Creatinine:** Direct measures of kidney function. *Why is it important to track this?* Elevated levels indicate kidney problems.
*   **Albumin:** Low levels can indicate advanced myeloma or nutritional problems. *Why is it important to track this?* Low albumin can be a sign of concern.
*   **LDH and Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):** Prognostic markers. *What it means:* Help assess the aggressiveness of the myeloma. *Why is it important to track this?* Help assess the aggressiveness of the myeloma.

This section highlights key blood tests commonly used in myeloma monitoring. Your doctor may order additional tests depending on your individual situation and treatment plan. Always discuss your specific blood test results with your doctor.

## 3. Managing Symptoms and Improving Quality of Life: Practical Tips

*   **Common Symptoms:** Fatigue, pain, constipation, and tingling in hands/feet are common. Talk to your doctor about managing these symptoms.
*   **Bone Problems:**
    *   **Management:** Pain management (analgesics, opioids if needed), weight-bearing exercise (walking, strength training, under the guidance of a physical therapist), calcium and vitamin D, bisphosphonates (discuss potential side effects like osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures with your doctor), orthopedic interventions (surgery for fractures, kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty), and low-dose radiation therapy.
*   **Kidney Problems:** Myeloma proteins can damage kidneys. *Why?* Protein deposition and cast nephropathy.
    *   **Management:** Early detection and management are crucial. Hydration, plasmapheresis (in some cases), and effective myeloma therapy. Regular monitoring of kidney function through blood tests is also crucial.
*   **Anemia:** Myeloma replaces normal bone marrow cells.
    *   **Management:** Iron, folate, or vitamin B12 supplementation, red blood cell growth factors (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents like erythropoietin (EPO) or darbepoetin), and blood transfusions. Dietary sources of iron may be helpful but often insufficient.
*   **Hypercalcemia:** Myeloma breaks down bone, releasing calcium.
    *   **Management:** Intravenous fluids, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin. Watch for symptoms like excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation, muscle weakness, confusion, and fatigue, and report them to your doctor.

## 4. The Evolving Treatment Landscape: What to Expect?

*   **Personalized Treatment Plans:** Treatment is tailored to individual needs, considering age, fitness, other health conditions, myeloma genetics (genetic mutations within the myeloma cells that can influence treatment choices and prognosis), and treatment goals. Factors also include the stage and risk stratification of your myeloma, prior treatments received, your personal preferences, and access to different therapies based on location and insurance.
*   **Earlier Use of Novel Therapies:** Clinical trials are exploring if using newer treatments earlier in the disease course can be more effective.
*   **Early Referral for Advanced Therapies:** Discuss CAR T-cell and bispecific antibody therapies with your doctor early, even if your disease is well-controlled with current treatment, to allow time for planning.

## 5. Key Considerations for Myeloma Patients:

*   **Rising Incidence:** The number of myeloma cases is increasing as the population ages.
*   **Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM):** Identifying patients with high-risk SMM is important because early treatment in this group may delay or prevent the progression to active myeloma and improve outcomes. Risk stratification tools, like the 20/2/20 model (20% or more plasma cells in the bone marrow, serum M-protein level of 2 g/dL or greater, and serum free light chain ratio of 20 or greater) help doctors determine which patients with SMM might benefit from earlier intervention.
*   **Importance of Clinical Trials:** Participating in clinical trials is crucial for advancing myeloma research and can offer patients access to cutting-edge treatments. **Discuss with your doctor if participating in a clinical trial is a suitable option for you, especially if you have relapsed or refractory myeloma.** In addition to online resources, your doctor can provide information on relevant clinical trials.

## 6. Support and Awareness: You Are Not Alone

*   **Myeloma Action Month:** Every March is dedicated to raising awareness about multiple myeloma.
*   **Patient and Family Seminars:** Organizations like the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) hold educational seminars.
*   **Online Communities:** Connect with others through online support groups for mutual support and education.
*   **Local Support Groups:** Ask your healthcare team about local myeloma support groups.
*   **Mental Health Support:** Consider seeking mental health support through counseling or support groups for yourself and your family.
