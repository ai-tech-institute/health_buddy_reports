# Understanding Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families (2024)

This summary provides key information about multiple myeloma, focusing on recent advancements and practical advice for patients and their loved ones.

## Key Updates & Breakthroughs

*   **Improved Survival:** The five-year survival rate for individuals with *symptomatic* multiple myeloma (those currently undergoing treatment) in the US has increased to over 62% due to the development of novel therapies. The initial improvements in survival were significantly driven by the introduction of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib (Velcade®) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like thalidomide (Thalomid®) and lenalidomide (Revlimid®), which paved the way for further advancements with monoclonal antibodies, CAR T-cell therapies, and bispecific antibodies. This is an average, and individual outcomes depend on stage, risk factors, and treatment response. While these improvements are encouraging, multiple myeloma remains a complex cancer, and ongoing research is crucial to further extend and improve the quality of life for patients.
*   **Monoclonal Antibodies:** Monoclonal antibodies have become a standard treatment option for multiple myeloma.
    *   **Daratumumab (Darzalex®):** FDA approved in 2015 and frequently used in newly diagnosed patients and in relapsed/refractory settings, often added to standard drug combinations. Daratumumab targets the CD38 protein on myeloma cells. Darzalex Faspro is administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin), offering convenience compared to the intravenous infusion of Darzalex. Common side effects include infusion reactions, fatigue, and low blood counts.
    *   **Elotuzumab (Empliciti®):** FDA approved for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma, specifically in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
    *   **Isatuximab (Sarclisa®):** FDA approved for relapsed/refractory settings in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Isa-Pd) and for newly diagnosed transplant-eligible patients in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Isa-VRd).
*   **CAR T-cell Therapies:** CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy where a patient's own immune cells (T cells) are collected and modified in a lab to recognize and attack myeloma cells. These modified cells are then infused back into the patient. CAR T-cell therapies targeting BCMA have shown promise, with newer trials testing therapies that target GPRC5D, offering an alternative if BCMA-targeted drugs stop working. Combination CAR T-treatments targeting both BCMA and GPRC5D are also under development. CAR T-cell therapy is a complex treatment primarily available at specialized centers, often in the context of clinical trials, for relapsed or refractory myeloma (myeloma that has returned after treatment or is not responding to treatment). This treatment can have serious side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potentially serious side effect, is an overreaction of the immune system that can cause flu-like symptoms, fever, and breathing difficulties. Neurotoxicity can affect the nervous system, potentially causing confusion, speech difficulties, or seizures. CAR T-cell therapy involves a multi-step process that includes collecting your T cells (apheresis), manufacturing the CAR T cells in a lab (which takes several weeks), and then hospitalization for infusion and monitoring. Patients need to be prepared for this time commitment and travel to specialized centers. Discuss with your doctor whether CAR T-cell therapy and clinical trial participation are suitable options for you, especially if you have relapsed or refractory myeloma.
*   **Quadruplet Therapy:** Frontline treatment strategies are evolving to consider a patient's suitability for quadruplet therapy (four-drug combinations), moving beyond just stem-cell transplant eligibility. An example is daratumumab (Darzalex®), bortezomib (Velcade®), lenalidomide (Revlimid®), and dexamethasone (Dara-VRd). Quadruplet therapy is considered due to potentially higher response rates, deeper remissions, or longer survival compared to standard triplets. However, it may also have more side effects, and the decision is made based on individual patient factors.
*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing:** MRD testing is increasingly used to assess treatment response and personalize therapy. MRD negativity means that after treatment, tests can't find myeloma cells even with very sensitive methods. This is a good sign and often associated with longer remission. MRD testing is typically done through bone marrow aspiration and flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing. While MRD testing is promising, it is not yet universally standard of care. This is partly due to factors like the cost of testing, the need for standardization across different labs, and ongoing research to definitively establish how best to use MRD results to guide treatment decisions and improve long-term outcomes in all patient populations.
*   **AI in Diagnosis:** New AI systems are being developed to detect multiple myeloma using microscopic blood images. AI systems could potentially speed up diagnosis and improve accuracy, leading to earlier treatment. AI diagnosis is not yet widely available in clinical practice and is still in the research phase.

## Treatment Advances

*   **New Drug Approvals:** Recently, the FDA approved injectable daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro) in 2020 and isatuximab (Sarclisa) in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Isa-VRd) in 2020 for newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for stem cell transplant. Sarclisa has also gained approval in China and Japan for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma after at least two prior therapies. Darzalex Faspro is administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin), offering convenience compared to the intravenous infusion of Darzalex.
*   **Personalized Treatment:** Clinical trials are testing personalized approaches using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to guide treatment decisions. NGS can identify specific genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities in myeloma cells, such as translocations involving chromosomes 14 and 16 or mutations in genes like *TP53* or *KRAS*. These genetic features can sometimes influence treatment choices. For instance, patients with a translocation t(11;14) might be evaluated for clinical trials investigating venetoclax, which targets BCL-2, a protein that may be overexpressed in myeloma cells with this translocation. Personalized treatment based on NGS is still largely in clinical trials but is a direction for future myeloma care and is not yet widely available outside of clinical trials. Clinical trials are crucial for advancing myeloma treatment. Discuss with your doctor if participating in a clinical trial is a suitable option for you.
*   **Bispecific Antibodies:** Bispecific antibodies are showing success by redirecting a patient's T cells to kill myeloma cells. Examples include teclistamab (Tecvayli®) or elranatamab (Elrexfio®), both FDA approved for relapsed/refractory myeloma after other treatments have been tried. Bispecific antibodies offer an advantage over CAR T-cell therapy as they are 'off-the-shelf' treatments, meaning they are readily available and do not require the patient's cells to be collected and modified, significantly reducing the time to treatment. These antibodies are designed to bind to both myeloma cells and T cells simultaneously, bringing them together so that the T cells can effectively kill the myeloma cells. These antibodies can have potential side effects, similar to CAR T-cell therapy, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potentially serious side effect, is an overreaction of the immune system that can cause flu-like symptoms, fever, and breathing difficulties. Neurotoxicity can affect the nervous system, potentially causing confusion, speech difficulties, or seizures. Clinical trials are crucial for advancing myeloma treatment. Discuss with your doctor if participating in a clinical trial is a suitable option for you.
*   **Maintenance Therapy:** Ongoing treatment after stem cell transplant, called maintenance therapy, is common, often involving lenalidomide (Revlimid®), sometimes with daratumumab (Darzalex®). Maintenance therapy is given after a stem cell transplant or other initial treatment to help keep myeloma in remission for longer and prevent it from returning. It often lasts for years. Common side effects of lenalidomide and daratumumab maintenance include fatigue, low blood counts, and infections.

## Important Considerations

*   **Incurable but Manageable:** Multiple myeloma is currently not curable, but it can be effectively managed for years with treatment.
*   **Rising Incidence:** The incidence of multiple myeloma is increasing as the population ages.
*   **Racial Disparities:** It is important to acknowledge that racial disparities exist in multiple myeloma. Studies show that Black individuals have a higher incidence of myeloma and experience poorer outcomes compared to white individuals. Researchers are actively working to understand the complex reasons behind these disparities, including genetic predispositions, access to healthcare, socioeconomic factors, and biological differences, with the goal of developing strategies to ensure equitable outcomes for all patients.
*   **Symptom Management:** Fatigue and pain are highly prevalent symptoms, highlighting the importance of symptom management. Strategies include pacing activities, exercise, and addressing anemia for fatigue, and pain medications, physical therapy, and supportive care for pain. Discuss symptom management with your healthcare team.

## Understanding Blood Work

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Low counts can indicate myeloma's impact on bone marrow or be a side effect of treatment. A general normal WBC range is 4,500 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter (4.5 to 11.0 × 109/L), but ranges vary by lab. Low counts can be due to myeloma itself or as a side effect of treatment.
*   **Hemoglobin:** A low hemoglobin count can indicate anemia, a key diagnostic criterion. A general normal range is roughly 12-16 g/dL for women and 13.5-17.5 g/dL for men, but ranges vary by lab. Low counts can be due to myeloma itself or as a side effect of treatment.
*   **White Blood Cells (WBC):** Low WBC counts can result from myeloma treatments, weakening the immune system. Low counts can be due to myeloma itself or as a side effect of treatment.
*   **Platelets:** Low platelet counts can increase the risk of bleeding. Low counts can be due to myeloma itself or as a side effect of treatment.
*   **Blood Chemistry Profile:** Checks kidney and liver function, which can be affected by myeloma.
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Identifies M protein, an abnormal protein produced by myeloma cells and a key marker for diagnosis and monitoring. The presence of an "M spike" is abnormal.
*   **Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP):** Estimates protein quantities in urine, also checking for M protein.
*   **Serum Free Light Chains:** Helpful in diagnosing and monitoring certain types of myeloma that don't produce detectable M protein on SPEP.
*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulins:** Measures levels of different types of antibodies to identify abnormalities.

**Disclaimer:** The normal ranges provided are general guidelines and may vary depending on the specific laboratory. Always consult with your healthcare provider to interpret your blood work results accurately.

## Symptoms to Watch For

*   Bone pain (especially in the back, hips, or skull)
*   Fatigue
*   Frequent infections
*   High calcium levels (causing thirst, frequent urination, confusion)
*   Weakness or numbness
*   Kidney problems (swelling, shortness of breath)
*   Unexplained weight loss

These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, and it's important to see a doctor for diagnosis if experiencing these symptoms, especially if they are new or persistent.

## Where to Find Support

*   **International Myeloma Foundation (IMF):** Focuses on research and patient education.
*   **Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF):** Dedicated to accelerating myeloma research.
*   **The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS):** Offers broad cancer support and financial assistance.
*   **CancerCare:** Provides counseling, support groups, and financial assistance.

## Living with Myeloma

*   **Empowerment:** Take an active role in your health by asking targeted questions and making informed decisions with your healthcare provider.
*   **Lifestyle Changes:** Focus on a balanced diet with whole foods, staying well-hydrated, especially with kidney involvement, and engaging in suitable exercise. For example, a balanced diet might include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Some patients may need to adjust their diet based on myeloma-related complications or treatment side effects, such as being mindful of sodium intake if kidney issues are present, or ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake for bone health. Suitable exercise could include walking, swimming, cycling, or light strength training. Start slowly and gradually increase intensity and duration as tolerated. Consult with your healthcare team or a registered dietitian for personalized dietary recommendations. Similarly, consult with a physical therapist or exercise specialist experienced in working with cancer patients to develop a safe and effective exercise plan.
*   **Early Detection:** Being aware of the symptoms of myeloma and seeking medical attention promptly if you experience them is important for timely diagnosis and treatment.
*   **Financial Support:** Explore various financial assistance options, including patient assistance programs offered by pharmaceutical companies, co-pay assistance foundations, non-profit organizations that provide financial aid to cancer patients, and government programs that may offer support for medical expenses.
*   **Emotional Support:** Seek emotional support from support groups, counselors, or loved ones.
