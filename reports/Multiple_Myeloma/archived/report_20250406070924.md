# Understanding Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

This summary highlights recent advancements and essential information to help you navigate your myeloma journey.

## 1. Treatment Advancements: What's New?

*   **Quadruplet Regimens: A New Standard for Newly Diagnosed Transplant-Eligible Patients:** Using four drugs together (quadruplet therapy) is now a preferred first-line treatment for newly diagnosed patients eligible for a stem cell transplant. A common combination is Daratumumab plus VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone). Phase 3 trials like the GRIFFIN and PERSEUS trials have shown this approach to be more effective. Transplant eligibility is typically determined by factors such as age, overall health, and organ function. Discuss with your doctor to understand if stem cell transplant is a suitable option for you. Ask your doctor about these trials if you're interested in learning more.
*   **Immunotherapy: Harnessing Your Immune System:** Immunotherapy, especially CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies, is increasingly used when myeloma returns or doesn't respond to initial treatments. These are typically used in later lines of therapy for relapsed/refractory myeloma.
    *   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** This involves modifying your own immune cells to target and kill myeloma cells. Examples of FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies include ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel, Carvykti) and idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, Abecma). Be aware that CAR T-cell therapy can have significant side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Your care team will closely monitor you.
    *   **Bispecific Antibodies:** These drugs help your immune cells recognize and attack myeloma cells. Examples of FDA-approved bispecific antibodies include teclistamab-cqyg (Tecvayli) and elranatamab-bcss (Elrexfio). Bispecific antibodies are often given as injections and may require step-up dosing to manage cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Similar to CAR T-cell therapy, bispecific antibodies can also cause Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, although often with different management strategies. Infections are another potential side effect due to their impact on the immune system. Your care team will monitor you closely for these side effects.
*   **MRD Negativity: A Deep Response:** Achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity after treatment is a major goal. It means that very sensitive tests, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) or flow cytometry, can't find any myeloma cells in your body. Achieving MRD negativity is a significant positive outcome and associated with longer remission times. However, it is important to understand that MRD negativity is not a guarantee of a cure, and ongoing monitoring is crucial as myeloma can potentially return. Doctors may use MRD testing to decide if treatment can be stopped or adjusted.
*   **FDA Approvals:**
    *   Injectable daratumumab with hyaluronidase (Darzalex Faspro) combined with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone is approved as a first-line treatment for *newly diagnosed* transplant-eligible patients. Infusion reactions are less common compared to intravenous daratumumab.
    *   Isatuximab (Sarclisa) with the same three drugs is approved for *newly diagnosed* transplant-ineligible patients. Infusion reactions are a potential side effect. Premedication is typically given to reduce the risk of infusion reactions.
    *   Common side effects of these combinations may include infusion reactions, fatigue, low blood cell counts, and peripheral neuropathy (especially with bortezomib-containing regimens). Talk to your doctor about how to manage these. For peripheral neuropathy, consider managing blood sugar if diabetic, and discussing pain management options with your doctor. For fatigue, consider pacing activities and ensuring adequate rest.
*   **Smoldering Myeloma: Treating Early?** The AQUILA trial is investigating if early intervention with daratumumab in patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma can delay or prevent progression to active myeloma. Treatment for smoldering myeloma with daratumumab in the AQUILA trial is still considered *investigational* and not yet standard of care. For most patients with smoldering myeloma, close monitoring is still the recommended approach.
*   **BCMA-Targeted Therapies:** B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a protein found on myeloma cells and is a key target for new therapies like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), and CAR-T cell therapies.

## 2. Understanding Your Blood Work: Key Markers

Here's what your blood test results mean in the context of myeloma:

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Monitors for anemia (low red blood cells), common in myeloma which can cause fatigue and weakness. Also checks white blood cells and platelets, which can be affected by myeloma and its treatment, impacting infection risk and bleeding. Red blood cells stacking up like coins (rouleaux formation) can sometimes be seen. Rouleaux formation was historically more commonly observed in myeloma, but with modern treatments, it's less frequently a prominent feature. However, its presence can still be noted in some cases.
*   **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel:** Checks kidney function, as myeloma proteins can damage kidneys. Also assesses liver function and electrolyte balance. Albumin and globulin levels are important for understanding protein abnormalities.
*   **M Proteins (SPEP/UPEP):** Directly measures the abnormal myeloma protein (M protein) in blood and urine, used to diagnose and track myeloma. Changes in M protein levels indicate treatment response or disease progression.
*   **Serum Free Light Chain Assay:** Used when M protein is low or not detectable on SPEP. Measures kappa and lambda light chains, an abnormal ratio can indicate myeloma and track treatment response, especially in light chain myeloma.
*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):** Provides prognostic information. Higher levels can indicate more advanced or aggressive myeloma.
*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulin Test:** Measures normal antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM). Low levels increase infection risk, common in myeloma.
*   **LDH:** Can be elevated in more aggressive myeloma or higher tumor burden. Another marker for prognosis.

## 3. Symptoms and Disease Stages

*   **Common Symptoms:** Fatigue (very prevalent), bone pain (especially in the spine and ribs), bone fractures, constipation, and peripheral neuropathy (tingling in hands/feet) are frequently reported. These symptoms are not exclusive to myeloma and can be caused by other conditions, so it's important to discuss them with a doctor.
*   **CRAB Criteria:** Used to assess the impact of myeloma.
    *   **Calcium:** Elevated calcium due to bone breakdown caused by myeloma cells.
    *   **Renal:** Kidney problems due to myeloma protein buildup or damage.
    *   **Anemia:** Low red blood cells because myeloma cells crowd out normal blood cell production in the bone marrow.
    *   **Bone:** Bone lesions or fractures caused by myeloma damaging the bone.
*   **Impact of Myeloma Proteins (M proteins):** Myeloma proteins can damage the kidneys, leading to weakness, shortness of breath, itching, and leg swelling. High levels of myeloma protein can also cause hyperviscosity, leading to confusion, dizziness, and stroke-like symptoms.
*   **Smoldering Myeloma:** An intermediate stage with higher levels of monoclonal protein and plasma cells but no active symptoms or tissue damage. It requires monitoring but not immediate treatment in most cases. The AQUILA trial is exploring *preventative* treatment in this stage and is still considered investigational in this setting.
*   **Revised International Staging System (R-ISS):** Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) considers **beta-2 microglobulin, LDH, and cytogenetics (genetic abnormalities in myeloma cells)** to determine the stage and prognosis.

## 4. Patient Support and Living with Myeloma

*   **Multidisciplinary Care Teams:** Your care involves a team of specialists from different areas of medicine.
*   **Patient Empowerment:** Actively participate in your health. Keep a record of your symptoms and side effects, bring a list of questions to your appointments, and don't hesitate to seek a second opinion if needed. For information on other ongoing clinical trials in myeloma, you can explore resources like clinicaltrials.gov.
*   **Lifestyle Changes:**
    *   **Proper nutrition:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein and calcium.
    *   **Sufficient fluid intake:** Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day, unless otherwise advised by your doctor, especially important for kidney health.
    *   **Adequate exercise:** Consider low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, or gentle yoga. Strength training with light weights can also be beneficial to maintain muscle mass, but always consult your doctor or a physical therapist before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have bone involvement.
*   **Support Networks:** Connect with peer organizations, support groups, and family/friends. Examples include the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF), and Myeloma Crowd. The LLS Clinical Trial Specialists can personally assist you throughout the clinical-trial process. Check their websites or call their hotlines for more information.
*   **Financial Assistance:** Explore organizations like Good Days (offering assistance with medication co-pays and travel costs), Patient Advocate Foundation (offering case management, financial aid, and insurance navigation support), and Patient Access Network (offering co-pay assistance and support for underinsured patients) for help with medication co-pays, travel expenses for treatment, and insurance premiums. Also, explore pharmaceutical company patient assistance programs or co-pay cards.
*   **Managing the impact on daily life:**
    *   For fatigue: pace activities, prioritize rest.
    *   For neuropathy: medication, physical therapy.
    *   For bone pain: pain medication, supportive aids.
    *   Family and friends can help by providing transportation, helping with household tasks, and offering emotional support.

## 5. Ongoing Research: The Future of Myeloma Treatment

*   **Understanding Molecular Changes:** Research continues to focus on the genetic and protein changes within myeloma cells to develop more effective, personalized treatments based on the specific genetic makeup of each patient's myeloma.
*   **Targeting Bone Destruction:** Researchers are developing drugs to block growth factors and reduce bone destruction caused by myeloma cells. Myeloma cells disrupt the normal balance of bone building and breakdown (osteoblasts and osteoclasts) and research is aimed at restoring this balance.
*   **Real-World Data Analysis:** Studies are analyzing data from patients treated in everyday practice (not just clinical trials) to understand how treatments work in broader populations and identify areas for improvement in care delivery.
*   **New Targets:** Besides BCMA, researchers are exploring other promising targets, such as GPRC5D, for novel therapies. Advancements in imaging techniques are also being developed for better disease monitoring.

## In Conclusion

Living with multiple myeloma presents challenges, but there is also significant hope. Research is rapidly advancing, leading to new and more effective treatments. Remember to actively participate in your care, lean on your support network, and stay informed. You are not alone.
