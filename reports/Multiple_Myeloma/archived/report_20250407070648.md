# Multiple Myeloma: Recent Updates for Patients and Families (2024-2025)

This summary provides an update on Multiple Myeloma (MM), focusing on information to help patients and their loved ones navigate diagnosis, treatment, and supportive care. We'll explain complex topics in easy-to-understand terms.

**1. Treatment Advancements & Strategies: New Hope for Myeloma Patients**

*   **Smoldering Myeloma Intervention (AQUILA Trial):** The AQUILA trial (Phase 3 study, results anticipated in 2025) is exploring whether early treatment with daratumumab (Darzalex), an antibody therapy, can delay or prevent smoldering myeloma (a precursor condition) from progressing to *active* myeloma. Daratumumab is currently approved for active myeloma and is being studied for earlier stages. The AQUILA trial is for patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet specific risk criteria for progression to active myeloma. Your doctor can determine if you are eligible based on factors like M-protein levels and bone marrow plasma cell percentage. Potential side effects include infusion reactions (fever, chills, nausea, cough, and shortness of breath), fatigue, and lowered blood counts. Not everyone experiences these side effects, and they are often manageable. Infusion reactions are most common during the first infusion and become less frequent with subsequent treatments. *Discuss with your doctor if early intervention for smoldering myeloma is right for you.*
*   **CAR-T Cell Therapy: A Powerful Immune Weapon:** CAR-T cell therapy, like Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel), is showing great promise. Carvykti is FDA-approved for adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have already tried several other types of treatment (typically including a proteasome inhibitor (like bortezomib or carfilzomib), an immunomodulatory agent (like lenalidomide or pomalidomide), and an anti-CD38 antibody (like daratumumab) - often referred to as 'triple-class exposed'). Mount Sinai is participating in the CARTITUDE 6 trial (Phase 3) exploring CAR-T as an *initial* treatment. CAR-T cell therapy typically involves collecting your T-cells (a type of immune cell), modifying them in a lab to target myeloma cells, and then infusing them back into your body. This process usually requires a stay at a specialized treatment center for monitoring. These therapies aim for **MRD negativity**, meaning no cancer cells can be detected after treatment, significantly improving outcomes. Anito-cel is another CAR-T therapy currently in *early investigational clinical trials* and is *not yet FDA approved*. This means it is not available for routine clinical use outside of a clinical trial. CAR-T therapy can have serious side effects like cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, requiring close monitoring and management in specialized centers. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response that can cause fever, flu-like symptoms, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, and nausea. The severity of CRS varies, and it is managed with supportive care and medications in specialized centers. Neurotoxicity (ICANS - Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome) can affect the nervous system, leading to confusion, tremors, speech difficulties, and in rare cases, seizures. Like CRS, ICANS is monitored and managed by specialized teams. *This is a powerful, but intensive treatment option.*
*   **Quadruplet Therapies: A New Standard of Care:** Quadruplet therapies, often combining four drugs, are becoming a new standard of care for *newly diagnosed active* multiple myeloma patients due to their improved effectiveness. Triplet therapies, often using a combination of three drugs like bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, have been a standard of care for myeloma. Quadruplet therapies build upon this by adding a fourth drug, such as daratumumab, to these established triplet combinations. Common quadruplet therapies often include daratumumab (Darzalex) combined with standard triplet regimens, such as Dara-VRd (daratumumab, bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and dexamethasone) or Dara-KRd (daratumumab, carfilzomib (Kyprolis), lenalidomide, and dexamethasone). *Talk to your doctor about whether a quadruplet therapy is right for you.*
*   **Bispecific Antibodies: Linking Cancer and Immune Cells:** Bispecific antibodies such as teclistamab (Tecvayli™) and elranatamab (Elrexfio™), both FDA-approved for relapsed/refractory myeloma after prior therapies, are offering new hope. Bispecific antibodies like teclistamab and elranatamab are for patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma, meaning their myeloma has come back after treatment or did not respond to previous treatments, such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and chemotherapy. Tecvayli, for instance, shrank cancer in 63% of patients in a trial who had tried multiple previous treatments. These antibodies work by bringing myeloma cells and immune cells together to fight the cancer. Common side effects can include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), infections, and lowered blood counts. While Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) can occur with bispecific antibodies, it is generally less severe and more manageable than CRS sometimes seen with CAR-T cell therapy. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) can occur with bispecific antibodies, with symptoms similar to flu-like illness, including fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, and fatigue. More severe CRS can involve difficulty breathing or low blood pressure, requiring hospitalization and management. Due to their effect on the immune system, bispecific antibodies can increase the risk of infections. Your healthcare team will monitor you closely for infections and may prescribe preventative medications. *Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare team.*
*   **Daratumumab Combinations: Boosting Existing Treatments:** Daratumumab (Darzalex) is frequently added to standard treatments to boost their effectiveness. The injectable form of daratumumab, Darzalex Faspro, is FDA-approved for transplant-eligible patients when used with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, making treatment administration easier. Darzalex Faspro offers a more convenient administration as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) taking only minutes, compared to hours for intravenous Darzalex infusions, but it is still an injection, not an oral medication.
*   **MRD-Driven Therapy: Tailoring Treatment to Your Response:** Using highly sensitive MRD testing is becoming important to guide treatment after initial therapy. These advanced tests can detect even tiny numbers of myeloma cells that standard tests might miss, helping doctors make more personalized treatment decisions based on how deeply you respond to therapy.

**2. Understanding Minimal Residual Disease (MRD): Eradicating Every Last Cancer Cell**

MRD stands for Minimal Residual Disease. It refers to the small number of cancer cells that may remain in the body after treatment. MRD testing is used to detect these cells. Achieving MRD negativity is a major goal of treatment as it is strongly associated with longer remissions and better long-term outcomes. *Your doctor may discuss MRD testing to assess your response to treatment and guide future therapy decisions.*

**3. Diagnostic and Monitoring Tests: Tracking Myeloma**

*   **CRAB Criteria:** The CRAB criteria (Calcium, Renal, Anemia, Bone) are used to recognize myeloma. The acronym "CRAB" stands for the first letter of each of the major symptoms: **C**alcium elevation, **R**enal (kidney) problems, **A**nemia (low red blood cell count), and **B**one problems.
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** This test measures the different types of cells in your blood.
    *   *Red Blood Cells (RBCs):* Low RBC counts (anemia) are common in myeloma because myeloma cells crowd out normal blood cell production in the bone marrow. RBCs contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen. Anemia can cause fatigue and weakness. Typical normal ranges (which can vary slightly between labs) are approximately: Red Blood Cells: 4.2 to 6.1 million cells per microliter (mcL). Your doctor will interpret your specific results in the context of your overall health.
    *   *White Blood Cells (WBCs):* Low WBC counts can result from myeloma treatments, reducing the body's ability to fight infections. Typical normal ranges (which can vary slightly between labs) are approximately: White Blood Cells: 4,500 to 11,000 WBCs per mcL. Your doctor will interpret your specific results in the context of your overall health.
    *   *Platelets:* These help with blood clotting. Low platelet counts are less common than low RBCs but can occur due to myeloma or certain treatments, leading to easy bruising or bleeding. Typical normal ranges (which can vary slightly between labs) are approximately: Platelets: 150,000 to 450,000 per mcL. Your doctor will interpret your specific results in the context of your overall health.
*   **Blood Chemistry Tests:** These tests measure different substances in your blood.
    *   *Kidney Function:* Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels indicate kidney function, which is often affected in myeloma.
    *   *Calcium:* High calcium levels (hypercalcemia) can be present in advanced myeloma due to bone breakdown. High calcium can cause fatigue, weakness, and confusion.
    *   *Albumin:* Low albumin levels can sometimes be seen in people with myeloma.
    *   *LDH and Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):* Levels of these substances are used to help determine the stage of myeloma.
*   **Serum Free Light Chains:** This test helps detect myeloma and monitor treatment response by measuring specific proteins (light chains) often overproduced by myeloma cells.
*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulins:** This test measures antibody levels to see if there are abnormal levels, which can be indicative of myeloma or affect your immune system.
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** SPEP is a key test to detect the M-protein, an abnormal protein produced by myeloma cells, helping diagnose and monitor the disease.
*   **Immunofixation:** This test identifies the specific type of abnormal protein (M-protein) detected in SPEP, crucial for diagnosis and classification of myeloma.
*   **B2M and Albumin Test:** These tests, along with other factors, help determine the stage of myeloma and prognosis. B2M can be high in more advanced myeloma, while albumin can be lower.

**4. Supportive Care and Living with Myeloma: Maintaining Quality of Life**

*   **Patient Empowerment:** Take an active role in your health and disease process. Ask questions and be informed!
*   **Lifestyle Changes:**
    *   *Nutrition:* Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.
    *   *Exercise:* Engage in regular, moderate exercise as tolerated, such as walking, swimming, cycling, or light weight training. Start slowly and gradually increase intensity and duration as you feel able. Always consult your *oncologist or a physical therapist specializing in cancer care* before starting a new exercise program to ensure it is safe and appropriate for your individual condition and treatment plan.
*   **Support Groups:** Local and online support groups offer understanding, encouragement, and valuable information. Visit the [MMRF Community Gateway](https://www.myeloma.org/get-support/community-gateway) and the [IMF Community Hub](https://www.myeloma.org/imf-community-hub) to find online forums, local support groups, and educational resources.
*   **Caregiver Support:** Caregiver-specific support groups and resources can provide guidance, emotional support, and practical advice.
*   **Managing Infections:** IVIG replacement can help reduce the risk of infection in patients getting CAR T and bispecific antibodies. In addition to IVIG, other important ways to reduce infection risk include frequent handwashing, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, ensuring vaccinations are up-to-date (after consulting with your doctor), and practicing good hygiene.
*   **Addressing Disparities:** The IMF's M-Power Initiative brings education and advocacy to underserved communities.

**5. Emerging Therapies: The Future of Myeloma Treatment**

*These therapies are investigational and not yet standard treatments. Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial is right for you.*

*   P-BCMACD19- ALLO1: An "off-the-shelf" CAR-T therapy (allogeneic), targeting both BCMA and CD19 proteins on myeloma cells. *Being allogeneic means it uses donor cells rather than your own.* (Investigational, not FDA-approved, currently in clinical trials only). If successful, this 'off-the-shelf' CAR-T therapy could provide a more readily available treatment option for more patients compared to current CAR-T therapies that use a patient's own cells.
*   ION251: Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) – *designed to deliver chemotherapy directly to myeloma cells to minimize harm to healthy cells.* (Investigational, not FDA-approved, currently in clinical trials only). Antibody-drug conjugates like ION251 aim to deliver chemotherapy directly to myeloma cells, potentially reducing side effects on healthy cells and improving effectiveness.
*   CID-103: GSPT1 degrader – *a novel drug that works by breaking down a protein (GSPT1) that myeloma cells need to grow.* (Investigational, not FDA-approved, currently in clinical trials only). GSPT1 degraders like CID-103 represent a new approach to stopping myeloma cell growth by targeting and breaking down a protein essential for cancer cell survival.
*   STI-1492: BCMA-targeting CAR-T cell therapy, in early trials. (Investigational, not FDA-approved, currently in clinical trials only).
*   Descartes 08: CAR-T therapy, in early trials. (Investigational, not FDA-approved, currently in clinical trials only).
*   RAPA-201: First-in-class small molecule targeting autophagy – *autophagy is a process cells use to recycle components; this drug aims to disrupt this process in myeloma cells.* (Investigational, not FDA-approved, currently in clinical trials only). By targeting autophagy, RAPA-201 aims to disrupt a key survival mechanism that myeloma cells use to recycle cellular components and resist treatment.
*   PHE885: Novel peptide-MHC (pMHC)-TCR T-cell therapy, in early trials. (Investigational, not FDA-approved, currently in clinical trials only). Peptide-MHC-TCR T-cell therapies like PHE885 are exploring novel ways to direct the immune system to recognize and attack myeloma cells.
*   Venetoclax: BCL-2 inhibitor, being explored in specific myeloma subtypes in clinical trials. (Investigational, not FDA-approved, currently in clinical trials only). Venetoclax is being investigated for use in specific subtypes of myeloma that overexpress the BCL-2 protein, offering a targeted treatment approach for these patients.
