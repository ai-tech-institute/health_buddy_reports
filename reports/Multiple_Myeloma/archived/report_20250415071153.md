            # Multiple Myeloma: Key Updates for Patients and Families (2025)

This summary provides the latest information on Multiple Myeloma, focusing on treatment advancements, symptom management, understanding test results, and support resources. **Always consult your healthcare team for personalized advice.**

## 1. Treatment Advancements

**Important Note:** Treatment options are constantly evolving. Discuss the best approach for *your* specific situation with your doctor.

*   **Expanded FDA Approvals:** As of late 2024/early 2025, the FDA has expanded the approvals for drugs like Daratumumab (Darzalex) and Isatuximab (Sarclisa) for use in combination with other therapies and in different stages of the disease.

    *   **Daratumumab (Darzalex):** Now used in expanded ways, such as in combination with VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) for newly diagnosed patients and in relapsed/refractory settings.
        *   The **GRIFFIN trial** published in *The Lancet Haematology* (2020) demonstrated improved progression-free survival with Daratumumab + VRd in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed patients.
        *   *Things to consider:* Daratumumab can cause infusion reactions, cytopenias (low blood counts), and increased risk of infection.
        *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**

*   **CAR T-cell Therapies:** For relapsed or refractory myeloma, CAR T-cell therapy uses your own modified immune cells (T cells) to target myeloma cells. Approved CAR T-cell therapies include ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel, Carvykti) and idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, Abecma), both targeting BCMA. Research explores maintenance therapy adjustments after achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity post-CAR T.

    *   *Things to consider:* Potential side effects include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity.
    *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**

*   **Bispecific Antibodies:** Typically used for relapsed or refractory myeloma, bispecific antibodies like teclistamab-cqhk (Tecvayli) and elranatamab-bcfm (Elrexfio) link myeloma cells and T cells, enabling immune-cell destruction of myeloma cells.

    *   *Things to consider:* Common side effects include cytokine release syndrome, infections, and cytopenias.
    *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**

*   **Quadruplet Therapy:** Quadruplet therapy, such as D-VRd (daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone), is increasingly used, especially for newly diagnosed patients who are transplant-eligible or considered high-risk.

    *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**

*   **Precision Medicine:** Tailored treatment based on myeloma's genetic/molecular characteristics. Venetoclax (Venclexta) shows efficacy in patients with t(11;14) translocation.

    *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**

## 2. Understanding Myeloma & Its Symptoms

*   **Common Symptoms:** Fatigue, bone pain, constipation, and peripheral neuropathy. Bone problems include pain, weakness, and fractures.
*   **Hypercalcemia (High Calcium):** Thirst, frequent urination, dehydration, kidney problems, constipation, abdominal pain, weakness, drowsiness, and confusion.
*   **Kidney Problems:** Myeloma proteins can damage kidneys. Early signs may only be detectable through blood/urine tests. Kidney failure can cause weakness, shortness of breath, itching, and leg swelling.
*   **Blood Count Abnormalities:** Anemia (fatigue), leukopenia (increased infection risk), and thrombocytopenia (bleeding issues).

*   **Early Detection:** These symptoms are not exclusive to myeloma. Consult a healthcare professional for persistent bone pain, unexplained fatigue, frequent infections, or elevated calcium levels.

    *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**

## 3. Interpreting Blood Test Results: What to Track & What it Means

Understanding your blood test results helps you actively participate in your care. Discuss any concerns with your doctor.

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Tracks red blood cells (anemia/fatigue), white blood cells (infection risk), and platelets (bleeding).
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Measures M-protein in your blood (the M-spike). A *decrease* indicates treatment is working.
*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulin Test:** Tracks levels of antibodies. Imbalances indicate how myeloma affects your immune system.
*   **Serum-Free Light Chain Assay:** Measures kappa and lambda light chains. An abnormal ratio assesses myeloma burden and treatment response.
*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) Test:** High levels may indicate advanced stage or poorer prognosis.
*   **Kidney Function Tests (BUN and Creatinine):** Detect kidney problems early.
*   **Calcium Levels:** High calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause fatigue, weakness, and confusion.

    *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**

## 4. Living with Myeloma & Support

*   **Self-Care:** Exercise, relaxation, setting boundaries, socializing (support groups), and discussing treatment options.
*   **Diet:** Balanced meals with lean protein, fruits/vegetables, and whole grains. Smaller, frequent meals may help with nausea. Drink 3 liters of fluids daily.
*   **Staying Active:** Walking, swimming, cycling, yoga, and tai chi.
*   **Support Groups:** Virtual and in-person options are available via IMF and LLS.
*   **Managing Infections:** Frequent handwashing, avoiding crowds/sick individuals.
*   **Financial/Transportation Assistance:** Patient assistance programs, LLS, IMF, and government programs.
*   **Survivorship Care Plan:** Discuss follow-up schedules, long-term side effects, and diet/exercise.

    *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**

## 5. Key Considerations

*   **Early Intervention in Smoldering Myeloma:** The **AQUILA trial** is investigating whether early daratumumab treatment in smoldering myeloma can delay progression to active myeloma. Results are anticipated to show a delay in progression, supporting earlier intervention strategies.
*   **MRD Testing:** Minimal residual disease (MRD) testing is increasingly used to assess treatment response and guide therapy adjustments.
*   **Personalized Treatment Plans:** Plans that balance efficacy with quality of life are essential.
*   **Specialized Myeloma Centers:** Provide access to the latest research, clinical trials, and a multidisciplinary team.
*   **Racial Disparity:** Black men and women have a greater than two-fold higher incidence of multiple myeloma. Ensure equitable access to diagnosis and treatment.

    *   **Discuss these points with your healthcare team.**
