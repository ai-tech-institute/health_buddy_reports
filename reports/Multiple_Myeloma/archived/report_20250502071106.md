# Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families in 2025

This guide provides essential information for patients and their loved ones, covering recent advances, key tests, symptom management, and actionable steps to navigate myeloma.

## 1. Advances in Treatment

Several FDA-approved therapies are extending survival and improving quality of life for myeloma patients. **Always discuss treatment options with your doctor to see if they are right for *your specific situation*.**

For newly diagnosed patients, treatment plans often depend on whether they are candidates for or plan to have a stem cell transplant (autologous stem cell transplantation - ASCT). Regimens like Dara-VRd or VRd are commonly used for transplant-eligible patients, while Dara-Rd, Rd, or Sarclisa-VRd might be preferred for those who are not transplant candidates or elect not to have a transplant.

*   **Daratumumab (Darzalex) Combinations (Dara-VRd, Dara-Rd, etc.):** Daratumumab (often called "dara") is an FDA-approved antibody treatment now commonly part of initial therapy for newly diagnosed myeloma. It's combined with standard regimens like:
    *   **VRd:** Bortezomib (Velcade), Lenalidomide (Revlimid), and Dexamethasone
    *   **Rd:** Lenalidomide (Revlimid) and Dexamethasone
    *   **VMP:** Bortezomib (Velcade), Melphalan, and Prednisone

    Recent trials, such as the PERSEUS trial in transplant-eligible patients, demonstrate that adding daratumumab to VRd significantly reduces the risk of myeloma recurrence (progression-free survival).

    **What to Watch For:** Before starting daratumumab, your doctor will screen for Hepatitis B and take steps to prevent reactivation if needed. It's also important to inform blood banks you are receiving daratumumab, as it can affect certain blood tests. Infusion reactions are common but usually manageable with pre-medications (steroids, antihistamines, acetaminophen). Other side effects include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, and lower blood counts (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia). Report any unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately. Treatments like growth factors might be used to manage low white blood cell counts.

*   **Bispecific Antibodies (Teclistamab/Tecvayli, Elranatamab/Elrexfio):** These FDA-approved drugs are for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three to four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 antibody (specific prior line requirements may vary by drug). They help your immune system target myeloma cells.

    **What to Watch For:** Bispecific antibodies can cause Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), which require close medical management, including medications (tocilizumab, steroids) and supportive care, often in a hospital. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) are potential side effects that occur when the activated immune cells affect other parts of the body. They represent an overreaction of the immune system requiring close medical monitoring. Symptoms include fever, chills, difficulty breathing, confusion, and seizures. Low blood counts and infections are also possible.

*   **CAR T-cell Therapy (Cilta-cel/Carvykti, Ide-cel/Abecma):** Cilta-cel (Carvykti) and Ide-cel (Abecma) are FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three to four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 antibody (specific prior line requirements may vary by drug). Your immune cells are modified to target myeloma cells and infused back into your body.

    **What to Watch For:** Like bispecific antibodies, CAR T-cell therapy can cause CRS and ICANS, requiring close medical management and hospitalization. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) are potential side effects that occur when the activated immune cells affect other parts of the body. They represent an overreaction of the immune system requiring close medical monitoring. Prolonged low blood counts and infections are also possible. The process involves apheresis (cell collection), manufacturing time (several weeks), and hospitalization for infusion and monitoring.

*   **Sarclisa (isatuximab) with VRd:** Sarclisa, another FDA-approved antibody drug, is combined with VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) for newly diagnosed patients who are *not candidates for* or *electing not to undergo* a stem cell transplant.

    **What to Watch For:** Side effects include infusion reactions (often managed with pre-medications), fatigue, nausea, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage, mainly from bortezomib), low blood counts (neutropenia), and infections.

## 2. Understanding Your Blood Work and Reports

Regular blood tests monitor your myeloma, treatment effectiveness, and any complications.

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
    *   **Why it matters:** Low red blood cells (anemia) cause fatigue, potentially requiring transfusions. Low white blood cells increase infection risk. Low platelets can lead to bleeding.
*   **Blood Chemistry:** Includes kidney function tests (BUN and creatinine), calcium levels, and other markers.
    *   **Why it matters:** Myeloma can damage kidneys, so monitoring kidney function is crucial. High calcium requires prompt treatment.
*   **Serum Free Light Chains:** Measures kappa and lambda light chains. The *ratio* is key.
    *   **Why it matters:** Detects myeloma even without a measurable M-protein spike. Tracks treatment response and relapse.
*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulins:** Measures antibody levels (IgA, IgG, IgM, etc.).
    *   **Why it matters:** One antibody type is often high in myeloma, while others are low, weakening your immune system and increasing infection risk. IVIG treatment might be needed.
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP) and Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE):** Measure and identify the abnormal protein (M-protein or M-spike) in your blood or urine.
    *   **Why it matters:** These tests are key for diagnosis and tracking the amount of myeloma protein, helping to monitor how well treatment is working.
*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** A bone marrow sample is examined.
    *   **Why it matters:** Confirms diagnosis, determines myeloma stage, and performs genetic testing. May be repeated to assess treatment response or blood count problems.
*   **Genetic Testing (FISH):** Looks for specific genetic changes in myeloma cells found in your bone marrow sample.
    *   **Why it matters:** Certain changes (del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), gain(1q)) are high-risk and affect prognosis and treatment.

## 3. Understanding Precursor Conditions: MGUS and Smoldering Myeloma

*   **MGUS (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance):** Abnormal protein in the blood, but no symptoms.
*   **Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM):** Higher level of abnormal plasma cells than in MGUS, but still no symptoms. "High-risk" SMM has higher plasma cell/M-protein levels, a high free light chain ratio, or high-risk genetic changes.

    **Why it matters:** If you have MGUS or SMM, regular checkups are crucial to monitor for progression. For high-risk SMM, close monitoring is standard. Treatment is being investigated in clinical trials but is *not* standard of care unless the disease progresses to active myeloma (CRAB features).

## 4. Managing Symptoms and Improving Quality of Life

*   **CRAB Criteria:** Signs of *active, symptomatic* myeloma that require treatment:
    *   **C**alcium elevation (high calcium levels in the blood)
    *   **R**enal dysfunction (kidney problems)
    *   **A**nemia (low red blood cell count)
    *   **B**one damage (bone pain, fractures)

    **Why it matters:** Report these symptoms to your doctor immediately.

*   **Pain Management:** Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid/Zometa or pamidronate/Aredia) or denosumab (Xgeva) strengthen bones and reduce fracture risk.
    *   **What to Watch For:** Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare but serious side effect. Have a dental checkup before starting and maintain good oral hygiene. Painkillers, including nerve pain medications like gabapentin or pregabalin, may also be prescribed.
*   **Bone Problems:** Myeloma weakens bones, increasing fracture risk. Imaging tests (skeletal survey, CT scans, PET/CT scans, or MRI) assess bone damage.
*   **Neuropathy (Nerve Damage):** Can cause tingling, numbness, or pain, often in hands and feet. Discuss these symptoms with your doctor. Dose adjustments of certain medications or specific nerve pain medications may help.
*   **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired is common from both myeloma and treatments. Pace yourself, get adequate rest, and discuss strategies like gentle exercise or managing anemia with your doctor.
*   **Infection Risk:** Due to weakened immunity (low normal antibodies/WBC), you are more prone to infections. Practice good hand hygiene, avoid sick individuals, and discuss vaccinations (flu, pneumonia, COVID-19, Shingles, etc.) and potential preventative medications (antibiotics, antivirals) with your care team. Report any signs of infection (fever, cough, unusual pain) immediately.

**Proactively discuss *all* side effects and symptoms with your care team. Many can be managed or reduced.**

## 5. Resources and Support

*   **Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF):** [www.themmrf.org](www.themmrf.org)
*   **International Myeloma Foundation (IMF):** [www.myeloma.org](www.myeloma.org)
*   **Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS):** [www.lls.org](www.lls.org)

These organizations provide information, support, and resources. Support groups connect you with others who understand your experience.

## 6. Important Considerations

*   **Racial Disparities:** Black people are more likely to develop and die from multiple myeloma than white people.
*   **Clinical Trials:** Essential for developing new treatments. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you. Search for clinical trials at [www.clinicaltrials.gov](www.clinicaltrials.gov) or contact patient advocacy groups. Clinical trials involve experimental treatments and may require frequent visits.
*   **Vaccinations:** Vaccinations are crucial for protecting your weakened immune system. Discuss recommended vaccines (like flu, pneumonia, COVID-19, Shingles) with your doctor.
