# Multiple Myeloma: Latest Advances and Practical Insights for 2025

Here's an update on multiple myeloma, focusing on breakthroughs and actionable information for patients and their families.

## Treatment Advancements

*   **Daratumumab (Darzalex) Combinations:** Daratumumab, an antibody that targets CD38 on myeloma cells, is a key drug often given subcutaneously (under the skin) to reduce infusion time and *infusion-related reactions* compared to IV infusions. The PERSEUS trial showed that adding daratumumab to bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and dexamethasone (Dara-VRd) significantly improved progression-free survival compared to VRd alone in newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients. Dara-VRd is now FDA-approved for this patient population. *What to track:* Monitor changes in blood counts and signs of infection. Subcutaneous administration significantly reduces *infusion-related reactions*.

*   **Bispecific Antibodies:** These recognize both a myeloma cell antigen (BCMA or GPRC5D) and an antigen on the patient's T cells (CD3), leading to cancer cell death. Step-up dosing and initial monitoring usually require a hospital stay or specialized center admission to manage Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) risk. The indication is for patients who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 antibody, and are *refractory to the last line of therapy containing at least one of these classes*.
    *   **Teclistamab (Tecvayli™):** Approved for patients who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 antibody, and are refractory to the last line of therapy containing at least one of these classes. *Targets:* BCMA and CD3. *Side Effects:* Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), infections, and cytopenias (low blood counts). *Administration:* Subcutaneous injection, often weekly or every other week after initial step-up dosing. *Efficacy:* Overall Response Rate (ORR) of ~60-70% in clinical trials. *What to track:* Fever, blood pressure, neurological changes (for CRS/ICANS), and signs of infection.
    *   **Elranatamab (Elrexfio™):** Received *accelerated* approval for relapsed/refractory myeloma, similarly after multiple prior lines of therapy. *Targets:* BCMA and CD3. *Side Effects:* Similar to Teclistamab. *Administration:* Subcutaneous injection, with a similar step-up dosing. *What to track:* Same as Teclistamab.

*   **CAR T-cell Therapies:** Reprogram a patient's T-cells to target and destroy myeloma cells. Typically a one-time treatment after apheresis and manufacturing, administered at specialized centers due to complexity and potential for severe side effects. REMS programs are in place due to potential risks.
    *   **Idecabtagene Vicleucel (ide-cel, Abecma):** *Target:* BCMA. *Side Effects:* CRS, ICANS, prolonged cytopenias, risk of infection, and secondary malignancies. *Efficacy:* Based on the DREAMM-2 trial, induces deep responses in relapsed/refractory patients. *Eligibility:* Typically for adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. *What to track:* Similar to bispecific antibodies, but also long-term monitoring for secondary malignancies and delayed cytopenias.
    *   **Ciltacabtagene Autoleucel (cilta-cel, Carvykti):** *Target:* BCMA. *Side Effects:* Similar to ide-cel. *Efficacy:* CARTITUDE-1 and CARTITUDE-4 trials demonstrated high MRD negativity rates and durable responses. *Eligibility:* Approved for adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received *at least one prior line of therapy*, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and are refractory to lenalidomide. *What to track:* Same as ide-cel.

*   **Quadruplet Therapies:** Regimens like daratumumab (Darzalex), bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and dexamethasone (Dara-VRd) are improving outcomes and becoming a standard of care, particularly for newly diagnosed patients (both transplant-eligible and ineligible in certain cases). Clinical trials are defining optimal patient populations and duration. *What to track:* Monitor blood counts, kidney function, and for signs of peripheral neuropathy (from bortezomib).

*   **Sarclisa (isatuximab):** Isatuximab + VRd is approved in Europe for newly diagnosed, transplant-ineligible patients based on the VIALE-MM study (another CD38 antibody). In the US, isatuximab (Sarclisa) is FDA-approved in combination with pomalidomide (Pomalyst) and dexamethasone for adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor, and are *refractory to lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor*. It is also approved in combination with carfilzomib (Kyprolis) and dexamethasone for adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received *1 to 3 prior lines of therapy*. *What to track:* Infusion-related reactions and changes in blood counts.

## Emerging Therapies and Approaches

*   **Earlier Use of Novel Therapies:** Clinical trials are exploring the use of CAR T-cell therapy (ide-cel and cilta-cel) and bispecific antibodies (Teclistamab and Elranatamab) earlier in the disease course, even for high-risk newly diagnosed patients or those with early relapse, to potentially achieve deeper, more durable responses and improve long-term outcomes by targeting minimal residual disease early. *Action:* Discuss clinical trial options with your doctor.

*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Advances in data analysis and technology are helping researchers and doctors understand myeloma better and personalize treatments. This may involve AI. *Action:* Discuss with your doctor how your specific data might inform treatment decisions.

*   **Home-Based Treatment:** Subcutaneous daratumumab (Darzalex) can be administered at home, offering convenience and cost-effectiveness. Eligibility depends on patient stability, training of patient/caregiver, and physician assessment. Home administration is typically done by a trained healthcare professional (e.g., visiting nurse). *Action:* Discuss the possibility of home administration with your healthcare team if you are receiving subcutaneous daratumumab.

*   **Next-Generation CAR T-cell Therapies & Trispecific Antibodies:** Research focuses on dual/trispecific antibodies targeting BCMA, GPRC5D, CD38, and CD3, and allogeneic ("off-the-shelf") CAR T-cell therapies.

## Understanding Multiple Myeloma and Its Management

*   **Symptoms:** Bone pain or fractures, backache, frequent infections, weight loss, and fatigue.

*   **Diagnosis:** Blood, urine, bone marrow, and imaging tests.

*   **Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT):** A key treatment strategy for many newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible patients. It serves as consolidation after induction therapy to deepen response and prolong remission. Novel therapies are often used *before* and *after* transplant.

*   **Immunomodulatory Drugs (IMiDs) and Proteasome Inhibitors (PIs):** These are foundational to many regimens. Examples of Immunomodulatory Drugs (IMiDs) are lenalidomide (Revlimid) and pomalidomide (Pomalyst), and Proteasome Inhibitors (PIs) are bortezomib (Velcade) and carfilzomib (Kyprolis).

*   **Smoldering Myeloma:** Treating *high-risk* smoldering myeloma (a precursor to multiple myeloma) with daratumumab (Darzalex) is being explored in *clinical trials* and is *investigational* to prevent progression to active myeloma and organ damage. This is *not* the standard of care for *all* patients with smoldering myeloma. Risk stratification is key. *Action:* Discuss risk stratification and potential clinical trial options with a myeloma specialist.

*   **Importance of MRD Negativity:** Achieving MRD negativity (absence of detectable cancer cells), measured by highly sensitive tests like next-generation flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing on bone marrow samples, is associated with long-term survival and sustained remission and is a goal of treatment for many patients. *Action:* Ask your doctor about MRD testing.

*   **Risk Stratification:** Genetic testing (FISH) at diagnosis is important to identify high-risk markers (e.g., del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16)) which guide treatment decisions. These markers, along with B2M and albumin (Revised International Staging System - R-ISS), help determine prognosis and treatment intensity.

*   **Supportive Care:** Managing bone health (e.g., with bisphosphonates or denosumab), preventing/treating infections (e.g., vaccinations, antivirals), and managing side effects like neuropathy are important aspects of care.

*   **Personalized Treatment:** Treatment approaches are tailored to each individual, considering factors like disease stage and overall health.

## Reading Blood Work: Key Metrics to Track

Understanding blood work can be empowering, though your doctor remains the primary interpreter.

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   *RBC (Red Blood Cells):* Low count (anemia) is common in active myeloma. Normal range for women is generally 4.2-5.4 million cells/mcL, and for men, it's 4.7-6.1 million cells/mcL.
    *   *WBC (White Blood Cells):* Low count increases infection risk. Normal range is generally 4,500 to 11,000 WBCs per microliter.
    *   *Platelets:* Low count (thrombocytopenia) can occur due to myeloma or treatments. Normal range is generally 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter. *Action:* Report any signs of infection or unusual bleeding to your doctor.

*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP) and Immunofixation:** Measure M-proteins (abnormal antibodies produced by myeloma cells). M-protein levels are measured in g/dL and tracking these numbers provides a quantitative way to monitor disease burden and response to therapy. A decrease indicates response; an increase may indicate progression. *Action:* Track M-protein levels to monitor treatment response.

*   **Quantitative Immunoglobulin Levels:** Measures levels of different types of antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM). One type is often high while others are low.

*   **Kidney Function Tests (BUN and Creatinine):** Indicate kidney function, often affected in myeloma. *Action:* Discuss elevated levels with your doctor.

*   **Calcium Levels:** High calcium levels (hypercalcemia) can occur in advanced myeloma. Symptoms include fatigue, confusion, increased thirst, frequent urination, constipation, and nausea. *Action:* Report these symptoms to your doctor.

*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) and Lactic Dehydrogenase (LDH):** Help determine the stage of myeloma. High levels often indicate more advanced disease.

## Support Resources

*   **Patient Navigation Centers:** Emotional support, resources, and connections.

*   **Myeloma Mentors:** Connect patients and caregivers with individuals who have shared experiences.

*   **Financial Assistance:** Organizations like The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), HealthWell Foundation, and CancerCare.

*   **Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF):** Resources to understand insurance coverage and find financial assistance.

## Important Considerations

*   **Racial Disparities:** Black people are more likely to develop and die from multiple myeloma than white people. Contributing factors may include potential biological differences and equitable access to treatment and clinical trials. *Action:* Black patients should discuss the implications of these disparities with their healthcare team, including timely diagnosis, access to novel therapies, and participation in clinical trials.

*   **Clinical Trials:** Crucial for advancing treatment and offer access to cutting-edge therapies for both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, especially those with high-risk features. Clinical trials are rigorously reviewed and monitored. *Action:* Search ClinicalTrials.gov or use resources from myeloma foundations like MMRF or LLS. Discuss clinical trial options with your myeloma specialist.

*   **Long-Term Management:** Multiple myeloma is not currently curable, but can be effectively managed for years with treatment.

*   **Myeloma Specialist:** Seek a Myeloma Specialist. Myeloma is complex, and management decisions are best made in consultation with or by a physician who specializes in this disease.
