# Understanding Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families (2025)

This update empowers you with the latest information on multiple myeloma, focusing on actionable insights for patients and their families. Remember that myeloma research is constantly advancing. Always discuss your specific situation and treatment options with your doctor for the most up-to-date and personalized advice.

## Key Advances in Treatment

*   **Quadruplet Regimens: The New Standard for Initial Treatment:** Four-drug combinations ("quadruplet regimens") are now favored upfront (first-line treatment at the time of diagnosis) for both transplant-eligible and ineligible patients.
    *   **VRd (Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, Dexamethasone):** VRd is an FDA-approved quadruplet regimen. Side effects can include fatigue, nausea, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in hands and feet that can sometimes be long-term), and increased risk of infections (e.g., upper respiratory infections, pneumonia, shingles). VRd involves oral medications and injections, following your doctor's specific schedule. The typical duration varies.  *Track your side effects and report them to your doctor promptly for management.*
*   **Immunotherapy: Harnessing Your Immune System:** Immunotherapy plays a growing role, especially for relapsed (myeloma has returned after a period of improvement) or refractory (myeloma has not responded to previous treatments) myeloma.
    *   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti) and idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) are FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies for *relapsed or refractory* multiple myeloma after multiple prior lines of therapy. Treatment is administered at specialized centers due to complexity. CAR T-cell therapy can have side effects like cytokine release syndrome (CRS - an overreaction of the immune system) and neurotoxicity (affects the nervous system). These are serious but manageable side effects that medical teams at specialized centers are trained to monitor for and effectively treat. Clinical trials are exploring CAR T-cell therapy earlier in the course of treatment for high-risk newly diagnosed patients or in earlier relapse settings. *Discuss with your doctor if CAR T-cell therapy is an option for you and what to expect.*
    *   **Bispecific Antibodies:** Teclistamab (Tecvayli) and elranatamab (Elrexfio) are FDA-approved bispecific antibodies for *relapsed or refractory* multiple myeloma after multiple prior lines of therapy. Administration and monitoring for side effects like CRS (an overreaction of the immune system) and neurotoxicity (affects the nervous system) require careful medical supervision. These are serious but manageable side effects that medical teams at specialized centers are trained to monitor for and effectively treat. *Report any unusual symptoms to your care team immediately.*
*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD): Measuring Remission Depth:** MRD testing detects tiny amounts of myeloma cells after treatment.
    *   **How it Works:** MRD is tested via bone marrow aspirate, using flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing.
    *   **What it Means:** MRD negativity is a positive prognostic factor and a goal of treatment. However, achieving MRD negativity outside of clinical trials does not routinely change treatment approaches yet. Its role in guiding routine treatment decisions is still under investigation but is a very active area of research. *Discuss MRD testing with your doctor and understand what the results mean in your specific situation.*
*   **New Drug Approvals & Studies:** New treatments are expanding options.
    *   **Darzalex Faspro:** Injectable daratumumab (subcutaneous daratumumab) is FDA-approved and offers faster administration compared to traditional intravenous infusions, improving convenience.
    *   **GPRC5D-Targeting CAR T-cell Therapy:** *Investigational* and currently in *clinical trials*. Understanding "clinical trial phase" (Phase 1 - safety, Phase 2 - efficacy and dose finding, Phase 3 - comparison to standard treatment) helps manage expectations.
*   **Treating Smoldering Myeloma:** "Watch and wait" remains standard for many with smoldering myeloma. The AQUILA trial results are being evaluated. Treating with daratumumab is a complex decision based on individual risk factors for progression to active myeloma. *Work with your doctor to assess your risk and determine the best course of action.*
*   **Personalized Medicine: Tailoring Treatment to You:** Treatment is becoming more personalized.
    *   **Venetoclax:** FDA-approved for patients with t(11;14) translocation (a specific genetic change in myeloma cells), typically combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone.
    *   **High-Risk Cytogenetics:** Treatment might be adjusted for high-risk cytogenetics (genetic features in myeloma cells that may make the disease more aggressive). Patients might be considered for more intensive initial treatment plans or autologous stem cell transplant. *Ask your doctor about genetic testing and how it may impact your treatment plan.*

## Understanding Your Diagnosis

*   **Improved Diagnostics:** Faster and more accurate results.
    *   **Advanced Imaging:** PET/CT scans, MRI, and low-dose CT scans detect bone lesions earlier.
    *   **Biomarker Detection:** Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) - tiny pieces of cancer DNA released into the bloodstream - and minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment in blood provide more sensitive measures of disease burden.
    *   **Genetic Testing:** FISH and NGS on bone marrow samples identify specific genetic abnormalities to personalize treatment.
*   **Rising Incidence:** Multiple myeloma is becoming more common as the population ages. Incidence and mortality rates are higher in Black individuals compared to White individuals, linked to socioeconomic factors, healthcare access, and potentially biological differences. Addressing these disparities is critical.
*   **Understanding Blood Work:**
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures blood cells. Low counts can mean myeloma cells are crowding out normal cells. *Monitor your CBC regularly and discuss any significant changes with your doctor.*
    *   **Blood Chemistry Profile:** Checks kidney and liver function, calcium, and electrolytes. *Report any symptoms of kidney problems (swelling, changes in urination) or high calcium (confusion, constipation) to your doctor.*
    *   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Identifies M protein (also known as monoclonal protein, paraprotein, or myeloma protein) in the blood â€“ an abnormal antibody made by myeloma cells. Measuring M protein helps track myeloma amount and treatment effectiveness. *Track your M protein levels and discuss trends with your doctor.*
    *   **Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP):** Estimates protein levels in urine.
    *   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** General markers providing information about myeloma stage and aggressiveness. *Ask your doctor how these markers relate to your individual prognosis.*
*   **Diagnosis:** Requires a plasma cell tumor or at least 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, PLUS one or more of these: high calcium, kidney problems, anemia, bone lesions, or increased light chain production. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration are essential.
*   **Staging:** The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) uses B2M, albumin, LDH levels, and specific gene abnormalities to determine the stage. *Understand your R-ISS stage and how it informs your treatment plan.*

## Living Well with Myeloma

*   **Symptoms:** Can include bone pain, fractures, fatigue, anemia, kidney problems, high calcium, and neurological issues like numbness or weakness. *Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor promptly.*
*   **Support Groups:** Connect with others for support. Visit the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) ([www.myeloma.org](www.myeloma.org)) and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) ([www.themmrf.org](www.themmrf.org)).
*   **Staying Active:** Helps with bone strength, fatigue, and mood. Consider gentle walking, light stretching, swimming, or chair exercises. *Consult with your doctor or a physical therapist to determine safe and appropriate activities.*
*   **Diet:** Eat a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables. Drink approximately 12 cups (3 liters) of fluids daily.
*   **Lifestyle Changes:** Adjust work hours, seek disability if needed, use mobility aids, and prioritize rest to manage fatigue. Try pacing activities throughout the day, establishing a consistent sleep schedule, and considering short naps.
*   **Emotional Support:** Seek help from oncology social workers, therapists specializing in chronic illnesses, or support groups.

## Empowering Yourself

*   **Take Charge:** Use reliable information to ask questions and make informed decisions with your doctor.
*   **Seek a Second Opinion:** Especially from a myeloma specialist at a comprehensive cancer center. Use the IMF or MMRF websites or NCCN-designated cancer center lists to find specialists.
*   **Stay Informed:** Treatment guidelines change frequently, so stay up-to-date.
*   **Research & Development:** Increased investment is fueling new therapies and strategies for better outcomes and long-term remission.
*   **Clinical Trials:** Clinical trials are crucial for developing new and better treatments. Participating in a clinical trial can provide access to cutting-edge therapies. Resources like clinicaltrials.gov, the IMF, and MMRF websites can help you find clinical trials.
*   **Communicate:** Have open and honest conversations with your doctor about your treatment goals, potential outcomes, and what to realistically expect during your myeloma journey.
