# Understanding Multiple Myeloma: Key Updates for Patients & Families (2025)

This summary provides essential updates on Multiple Myeloma for patients and families, focusing on treatment advancements, symptom awareness, and helpful resources.

## Key Treatment Updates & Emerging Therapies

*   **Quad Therapies: A New Standard?** Quadruple drug combinations are increasingly used for *newly diagnosed* patients, often those eligible for transplant, because they lead to better responses and longer remissions. A common regimen is **Daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Dara-VRd)**.
    *   **What to consider:** Discuss with your doctor if Dara-VRd is right for you. Be aware of potential side effects such as infusion reactions (from Daratumumab) and neuropathy (from bortezomib).

*   **Daratumumab & Isatuximab Combinations:**
    *   **Daratumumab (Darzalex):** Approved for initial treatment of *newly diagnosed* patients (since 2015), adding daratumumab to VRd can lower the risk of disease progression.
    *   **Isatuximab (Sarclisa):** Often used with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for patients *not* eligible for stem cell transplants.
    *   **What to consider:** These monoclonal antibodies can cause infusion reactions and fatigue, which are generally manageable.

*   **CAR T-cell Therapy: A Powerful Option for Relapsed Myeloma**
    *   CAR T-cell therapy targeting BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) is effective for *relapsed* myeloma after multiple treatments. FDA-approved options include **idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma)** and **ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti)**.
    *   **New Targets:** CAR T-cell therapy targeting GPRC5D is in early clinical trials, offering an alternative when BCMA-targeted therapies aren't effective. These are *not* standard treatment outside of clinical trials.
    *   **Boosting CAR T-cell Effectiveness:** Research suggests bortezomib *may* enhance BCMA CAR-T therapy.
    *   **Optimizing Manufacturing:** Researchers are improving CAR T-cell manufacturing for faster results and lower costs.
    *   **What to consider:** CAR T-cell therapy has serious but manageable side effects like cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Treatment requires travel to specialized centers and a significant time commitment.

*   **Bispecific Antibodies: A New Class of Drugs for Relapsed Myeloma**
    *   Three bispecific antibodies are FDA-approved for *relapsed* myeloma:
        *   **Teclistamab (Tecvayli):** Targets BCMA.
        *   **Elranatamab (Elrexfio):** Targets BCMA.
        *   **Talquetamab (Talvey):** Targets GPRC5D.
    *   **What to consider:** These are given as injections and potential side effects include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and injection site reactions (redness, pain, swelling).

*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD): A Key Indicator of Treatment Success**

    *   **What is MRD?** MRD refers to a small number of myeloma cells after treatment, detectable only with sensitive tests.
    *   Achieving MRD-negativity is a good prognostic marker. MRD testing is not yet standardized, and its role in routine decision-making is evolving.
    *   **What to consider:** MRD negativity is a goal, but not always achievable. Treatment success is evaluated through multiple factors.

## Understanding Myeloma: Early Detection & What to Watch For

*   **Early Symptoms:** Be aware of symptoms like bone pain, fatigue, frequent infections, **unintentional weight loss of unknown cause, persistent back pain, signs of nerve damage, and unexplained fractures.** These symptoms are non-specific and can be caused by other conditions.

*   **CRAB Criteria:** Remember the CRAB criteria:
    *   **C**alcium elevation
    *   **R**enal impairment
    *   **A**nemia
    *   **B**one lesions
    *   **What to consider:** These are signs of *organ damage* due to myeloma and require prompt medical evaluation. *If you have unexplained anemia, especially if iron deficiency has been ruled out, discuss with your doctor the possibility of a paraprotein test to screen for myeloma or related conditions.*

*   **Smoldering Myeloma (SMM):** Often symptom-free, SMM is usually found incidentally. Early treatment of high-risk SMM may delay progression to active myeloma. Risk stratification tools like the Mayo Clinic risk stratification or the 20/2/20 risk stratification exist.

*   **Precursor Conditions:** Understanding precursor conditions like MGUS and SMM is essential for early diagnosis and monitoring.

## Living Well with Myeloma: Support & Empowerment

*   **Empowerment:** Take an active role in your health! Use reliable information to ask targeted questions and participate in treatment decisions.

*   **Online Support Groups:** Connect with others!
    *   Myeloma UK: Friends and Family Support Group (Zoom).
    *   Cancer Care: 15-week online support group for myeloma patients in treatment.
    *   Strength Through Inspiration: Virtual support for Multiple Myeloma Patients & Caregivers with Young Children.
    *   Myeloma Canada: Facebook support groups.
    *   Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center: Virtual support for people receiving care at MSK for multiple myeloma.
    *   **Actionable Step:** Before joining any listed support group, please verify that it is still active and that the provided links are current. It is highly recommended to check for the most up-to-date support groups and resources through the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) ([www.myeloma.org](www.myeloma.org)) or the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) ([www.themmrf.org](www.themmrf.org)). These organizations are excellent sources for reliable and current patient support information.

## Understanding Your Blood Work: Key Metrics

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Checks for anemia (low hemoglobin), white blood cell count, and platelet count. *Anemia is common in myeloma and can worsen fatigue; low platelet counts can increase bleeding risk; abnormalities in white blood cell counts can be related to myeloma or treatment effects.*
*   **Blood Chemistry Test:** Shows kidney function (creatinine), protein levels (albumin), calcium levels, and lactic dehydrogenase levels (LDH). *Kidney function is important as myeloma can affect the kidneys; calcium levels can be elevated in myeloma and need to be monitored.*
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Measures abnormal proteins (paraproteins or M-proteins) in your blood, a key marker of myeloma. This test helps diagnose myeloma and track how well treatment is working.
*   **Immunofixation:** Identifies the type of paraprotein.
*   **Serum Free Light Chain (SFLC):** Detects small proteins called light chains in the blood.
*   **B2M and albumin test:** Albumin levels can be lower and B2M levels can be higher than normal in myeloma.
*   **M spike lab test:** Determines the amount of M protein in your blood. The presence of any M spike is abnormal.
