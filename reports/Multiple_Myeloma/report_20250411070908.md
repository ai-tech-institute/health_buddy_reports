# Understanding the Latest in Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families

Here's a concise overview of recent advances and key information about Multiple Myeloma, designed to empower patients and their families.

## 1. Breakthroughs in Treatment

*Key terms defined: **Relapsed** means the myeloma has returned after a period of remission. **Refractory** means the myeloma is not responding to treatment. **Frontline** treatment is the initial treatment given when myeloma is first diagnosed. **Maintenance therapy** is long-term treatment after initial therapy to prevent relapse. **High-risk patients** have specific disease characteristics that make their myeloma more aggressive. **Deeper remission** means a greater reduction in myeloma cells, ideally to the point where they are undetectable (MRD negativity).*

*   **CAR T-cell Therapies:** Genetically engineered immune cells target and destroy myeloma cells. FDA-approved options like ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti) and idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) are available for *relapsed or refractory myeloma* after multiple prior treatments (typically at least 3-4 lines including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody).

    *   **The CAR T-cell process from a patient perspective:** This involves apheresis (collection of your T-cells), followed by a manufacturing process where your T-cells are genetically engineered to fight myeloma, and finally, infusion of the CAR T-cells back into your body. This therapy requires a significant time commitment and coordination due to specialized centers and manufacturing.
    *   **Important:** Requires hospitalization and frequent monitoring due to potential side effects like Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS, caused by the immune system's overreaction) and neurotoxicity (affecting the brain and nervous system). These side effects are closely monitored and managed by your healthcare team.
    *   Eligibility depends on treatment history, performance status, and organ function. Research explores new targets (GPRC5D, BCMA combinations) to prevent relapse. CAR T-cell therapies have shown durable remissions in some patients.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "Am I eligible for CAR T-cell therapy? What are the eligibility criteria? What are the specific risks and benefits for me? Where is this treatment offered? What is the expected duration of response?"

*   **Bispecific Antibodies:** These drugs link T cells and myeloma cells for cancer elimination. Teclistamab (Tecvayli™) and elranatamab (Elrexfio) are FDA-approved for relapsed or refractory myeloma after prior treatments. Teclistamab targets BCMA and CD3, while Elranatamab also targets BCMA and CD3. They are administered via subcutaneous injection.

    *   **Important:** Often require a 'step-up' or gradual dose escalation to mitigate the risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), especially with the first few doses. Common side effects include CRS, infections, and injection site reactions. Close monitoring during and after injections, particularly for CRS, is crucial. Eligibility depends on treatment history and health status. Prior exposure to BCMA-targeted therapy might affect eligibility for some bispecific antibodies.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "Am I eligible for bispecific antibody therapy? What are the specific targets of the bispecific antibody you are recommending? What are the potential side effects, and how will they be managed? How will I receive the injections?"

*   **Monoclonal Antibodies:** Daratumumab (Darzalex®) and Isatuximab (Sarclisa) target the CD38 protein on myeloma cells. Daratumumab is frequently added to standard regimens in *frontline* and *relapsed/refractory* settings like VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) or VMP (bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone). Infusion reactions are a common side effect, most common with the first infusion, and are generally manageable with premedications and slowing the infusion rate. Injectable daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro) is approved for stem cell transplant-eligible patients and offers the convenience of subcutaneous administration compared to intravenous infusion. Isatuximab is approved with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone for transplant-ineligible patients; a common side effect is neutropenia (low white blood cell count), which increases the risk of infection and requires monitoring and potentially supportive treatment. These antibodies are typically used with other drugs.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "Is a monoclonal antibody part of my treatment plan? What are the potential side effects of the specific monoclonal antibody being recommended? How will my blood counts be monitored?"

*   **Quadruplet Therapy:** *Frontline* treatment increasingly includes quadruplet therapy, especially for *high-risk patients* (those with specific genetic abnormalities like del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), or high ISS stage) or to achieve *deeper remission* (ideally MRD negativity). Quadruplet therapy is increasingly being considered for a broader range of newly diagnosed patients, including standard-risk patients in some centers, to achieve deeper remissions. Regimens include daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Dara-VRd) or daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (Dara-CyBorD). Suitability is based on transplant eligibility and risk.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "Is quadruplet therapy appropriate for me? What are my risk factors, and how do they influence treatment decisions? What is the goal of achieving MRD negativity?"

*   **Maintenance Therapy:** Long-term therapy with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and/or daratumumab is typically recommended after stem cell transplant to prolong remission and survival by preventing or delaying myeloma relapse. This can continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Potential side effects include fatigue, cytopenias (low blood counts), and infection risk, even if generally well-tolerated.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "What maintenance therapy is recommended for me, and for how long? What are the potential side effects of maintenance therapy, and how will they be managed?"

## 2. Understanding Your Blood Work

Understanding your blood work reports is crucial for monitoring your myeloma, treatment response, and overall health. These tests help your healthcare team assess the disease and adjust your treatment plan as needed.

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Monitors red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Myeloma can cause low counts (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia). Anemia is often present, with hemoglobin levels frequently falling below 10 g/dL (normal range is generally higher). Track your counts and discuss any significant drops with your doctor. Normal hemoglobin range is generally around 12-16 g/dL for women and 13.5-17.5 g/dL for men (ranges may vary slightly between labs). *Why it's important:* Low blood counts can cause fatigue, increased risk of infection, and bleeding problems.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "What are my normal blood count ranges? What level of change in my blood counts should I be concerned about?"

*   **Blood Chemistry Profile:** Checks kidney function, calcium, albumin, electrolytes, and *liver function tests* (like AST, ALT, bilirubin). Kidney problems are common in myeloma due to paraproteins damaging the kidneys. High calcium occurs because myeloma cells can release substances that cause bone breakdown, releasing calcium into the blood. Kidney and/or treatment problems can affect liver function. Monitor kidney function markers (creatinine, BUN) to take preemptive actions. High calcium levels (hypercalcemia) can cause extreme thirst, frequent urination, dehydration, kidney problems, constipation, abdominal pain, weakness, drowsiness, and confusion. *Why it's important:* Detects and monitors kidney damage, liver damage, and other organ dysfunction.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "What are my kidney and liver function levels? What level of calcium in my blood should I be concerned about?"

*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Identifies M proteins (abnormal antibodies produced by myeloma cells). An M spike indicates abnormal plasma cells. Track M-protein levels to monitor treatment response. A decrease, such as a 50% or greater reduction, often indicates the treatment is working. *Why it's important:* Directly measures the myeloma protein level in the blood.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "What is my M-protein level? What constitutes a significant decrease in my M-protein level?"

*   **Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP):** Estimates the quantity of certain proteins in your urine. UPEP is particularly important in light chain myeloma, where M-protein might be more readily detected in urine than blood. *Why it's important:* Detects myeloma proteins that may be present in the urine but not easily detected in the blood.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "Is a UPEP test necessary for me? What protein levels are being monitored in my urine?"

*   **Serum Free Light Chains:** Measures kappa and lambda light chains. Light chains are parts of antibodies and in light chain myeloma, only light chains are overproduced. The kappa/lambda ratio is important. Helps diagnose light chain myeloma. *Why it's important:* Detects and monitors myeloma in patients whose myeloma cells only produce light chains.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "What are my free light chain levels and kappa/lambda ratio? How are these values being used to monitor my treatment response?"

*   **Immunofixation:** Identifies the type of M-protein (IgG, IgA, etc.) and light chain. This test is done *after* SPEP if an M-spike is detected to identify the specific type of abnormal protein. *Why it's important:* Identifies the specific type of myeloma protein being produced.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "What type of M-protein is being produced by my myeloma cells?"

*   **B2M and Albumin Test:** B2M (Beta-2 microglobulin) and albumin are prognostic markers, meaning they can help predict the course of the disease. High B2M and low albumin can indicate more aggressive disease. B2M may be high, and albumin low in myeloma. *Why it's important:* Helps assess the aggressiveness of the myeloma.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "What are my B2M and albumin levels? How do these values influence my prognosis?"

## 3. Recognizing Myeloma Symptoms

*   **Bone-Related (Skeletal):** Bone pain (back, hips, skull, spine, ribs, pelvis, long bones), bone weakness, fractures, spinal cord compression. Myeloma bone pain is often constant, worse at night, and not relieved by rest, unlike typical back pain. Spinal cord compression is an emergency because myeloma can compress the spinal cord, leading to paralysis if untreated. Symptoms like new onset back pain, weakness in legs, or bowel/bladder dysfunction require immediate attention.
*   **Blood-Related (Hematologic):** Anemia (fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath), infections, bleeding, tingling in hands/feet (neuropathy, can be treatment-related or myeloma itself). Neuropathy can be peripheral (hands and feet) and caused by *both the myeloma itself and certain treatments* (like bortezomib). Differentiate between sensory neuropathy (tingling, numbness) and motor neuropathy (weakness).
*   **Kidney-Related (Renal):** Kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, itching, leg swelling), dehydration. Signs of kidney problems include decreased urine output and dark urine.
*   **Calcium-Related (Metabolic):** High Calcium Levels (hypercalcemia): Extreme thirst, frequent urination, dehydration, kidney problems, constipation, abdominal pain, weakness, drowsiness, and confusion. Hypercalcemia can be serious and requires prompt treatment.
*   **General (Constitutional):** Fatigue, constipation, unexplained weight loss.

**Important:** Report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare team immediately. Spinal cord compression requires immediate medical attention.

## 4. Finding Support

*   **Patient Navigation Centers:** Offer emotional support and resources. Organizations like LLS offer patient navigation.
*   **Myeloma Mentors:** Connect patients and caregivers with experienced individuals. The MMRF and IMF offer mentor programs.
*   **Online Communities:** The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) Community Gateway ([https://community.themmrf.org/](https://community.themmrf.org/)) and the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) Community Hub ([https://community.myeloma.org/](https://community.myeloma.org/)).
*   **Support Groups:** Local and online groups for sharing experiences and emotional support. Ask your cancer center or local hospital about myeloma support groups.
*   **Financial Assistance:** Organizations like The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS - [https://www.lls.org/](https://www.lls.org/)), Patient Access Network (PAN) Foundation ([https://www.panfoundation.org/](https://www.panfoundation.org/)), and pharmaceutical company patient assistance programs. These offer co-pay assistance, travel grants, and medication assistance.
*   **Caregiver Support:** Recognize the challenges faced by caregivers. Organizations like LLS, MMRF and IMF offer caregiver-specific resources.

## 5. Monitoring MRD

*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) testing** assesses treatment response. Detecting even small traces of cancer cells allows for personalized strategies. MRD negativity ideally means no detectable myeloma cells using highly sensitive tests, associated with deeper and longer remissions. Methods of MRD testing include bone marrow aspirate and flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing (NGS), and blood-based MRD tests (if applicable and patient-friendly). *It's important to understand that MRD negativity is a goal, but not always achievable, and achieving MRD negativity is not the only measure of successful treatment or long-term outcome. Some patients may have good outcomes even without achieving MRD negativity*. Ask your doctor if MRD testing is appropriate for you, and what the results mean in terms of your future treatment plan.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "Is MRD testing recommended for me? What method of MRD testing will be used? What does MRD negativity mean in my specific case?"

## 6. New Diagnostic Tools

*   **New Diagnostic Tool:** Researchers are exploring novel diagnostic tools, such as an 'Adaptive and Attention-based Mask R-FCN (AAMR-FCN)' AI system, to improve the detection of multiple myeloma using microscopic blood images. This AI system is currently in the research phase and aims to potentially offer a more sensitive and efficient method for diagnosis. This is promising but still in research and not yet standard clinical practice. Further studies are needed to validate its clinical utility and accessibility for widespread patient use.

## 7. Understanding Smoldering Myeloma

*   Smoldering myeloma is a precursor condition that doesn't yet cause organ damage but has a risk of progressing to active myeloma. *High-risk* smoldering myeloma has risk factors like higher M-protein levels, a higher percentage of plasma cells in bone marrow, and an abnormal free light chain ratio. Treating smoldering myeloma to delay or prevent this progression and subsequent organ damage is a promising area of research. The AQUILA trial is a Phase III clinical trial, meaning it is comparing daratumumab to a placebo or observation in a large group of patients to definitively determine efficacy and safety, studying the effectiveness of daratumumab in delaying the progression of smoldering myeloma to active myeloma. The trial is evaluating whether early intervention with daratumumab can improve progression-free survival for patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma. *There are other clinical trials investigating early interventions in smoldering myeloma beyond the AQUILA trial*.

    *   **Questions to Ask Your Doctor:** "Do I have smoldering myeloma? What are my risk factors for progression to active myeloma? Is participation in a clinical trial like the AQUILA trial, or any other trial, right for me?"

## 8. Understanding Clinical Trials

*   Clinical trials are crucial for advancing myeloma research and improving treatment options. They allow researchers to test new therapies and approaches. Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial is right for you. You can find more information about clinical trials at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/).
