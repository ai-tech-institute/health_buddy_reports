## Multiple Myeloma: Key Updates for Patients and Families (Late 2023/Early 2024)

This summary presents the latest research (as of late 2023/early 2024) shaping multiple myeloma treatment, designed to help you navigate your journey. Consult your healthcare team for personalized advice.

### 1. Understanding Treatment Approaches

*   **Quadruplet Therapy (Dara-VRd):** A common *first-line* treatment for *newly diagnosed* patients (transplant-eligible/ineligible). Combines daratumumab (an anti-CD38 antibody, which targets a protein on myeloma cells), bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor, which blocks enzymes important for cancer cell survival), lenalidomide (an IMiD, which affects the immune system and kills myeloma cells), and dexamethasone (a steroid that also kills myeloma cells and manages side effects). Proactive side effect management is key. Antiviral medication (like acyclovir) prevents shingles.

*   **CAR-T Cell Therapy and Bispecific Antibodies:** Immunotherapies for *relapsed/refractory* myeloma, studied earlier in clinical trials, administered at specialized centers. These therapies are part of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) programs.

    *   **CAR-T Details:** CAR-T (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell) therapy modifies your immune cells to attack myeloma. The process involves cell collection (leukapheresis), manufacturing time, lymphodepletion chemotherapy, infusion, and post-infusion monitoring.
        *   **Cilta-cel (Carvykti®):** FDA-approved for *relapsed/refractory* MM patients who have received *at least two* prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Watch for Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), and prolonged low blood cell counts.
        *   **Idecabtagene Vicleucel (Ide-cel, Abecma®):** FDA-approved for *relapsed/refractory* patients who have received *at least two* prior lines, including an IMiD, a PI, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Monitor for similar side effects as Cilta-cel.
    *   **Bispecific Antibody Details:** These drugs bind to myeloma cells and immune cells, helping your immune system kill the cancer. Many are administered subcutaneously (under the skin) after initial monitoring doses.
        *   **Teclistamab (Tecvayli™):** FDA-approved for adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Targets BCMA (a protein found on myeloma cells) and CD3 (found on immune cells/T-cells). Monitor for CRS, ICANS, and infections.
        *   **Talquetamab (Talvey™):** FDA-approved for adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Targets GPRC5D and CD3. Monitor for CRS, ICANS, infections, skin/nail changes, and taste disturbances (dysgeusia).
        *   **Elranatamab (Elrexfio™):** FDA-approved for adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Targets BCMA and CD3. Monitor for CRS, ICANS, and infections.
        *   **Cevostamab:** Currently in clinical trials, targeting FcRH5.
        *   **Important for all Bispecifics:** Careful monitoring and management of side effects like CRS, ICANS, and infection risk are crucial, especially during initial doses.

*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing:** Checks for remaining myeloma cells after treatment using bone marrow. NGS (next-generation sequencing) is generally more sensitive than MPF (multi-parameter flow cytometry). Achieving MRD negativity is a good sign. Outside clinical trials, using MRD to *change* treatment isn't standard because research is ongoing to see if this improves outcomes without increasing relapse risk.

*   **Personalized Treatment:** Therapies are increasingly tailored to individual risk factors, genetics, and biomarkers. Higher-risk patients may receive more intensive initial therapy or longer maintenance.

*   **Genetic Testing (FISH):** Identifies genetic abnormalities like del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), and gain/amp(1q) in bone marrow plasma cells. These can predict prognosis and influence treatment.

*   **Managing Smoldering Myeloma (SMM):** Daratumumab is FDA-approved for *high-risk* SMM (based on M protein level, plasma cell percentage, free light chain ratio, and potentially genetics) to reduce progression risk. Active surveillance (watch and wait) is the standard for *lower-risk* SMM.

*   **CELMoDs (e.g., Mezigdomide):** *Newer generation* drugs similar to IMiDs (lenalidomide, pomalidomide) but with enhanced potency. Showing *promising results* in trials for relapsed/refractory patients.

*   **Bortezomib and BCMA:** Research explores if bortezomib might increase BCMA levels on myeloma cells, potentially improving BCMA-targeted therapy effectiveness.

### 2. Diagnosis and Monitoring

*   **Early Diagnosis:** Be alert for CRAB symptoms: high Calcium, Renal (kidney) dysfunction, Anemia, and Bone lesions. Also, Anemia with preserved iron stores or unexplained hypercalcemia warrants assessment for a monoclonal gammopathy.

*   **Key Blood Tests:**
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Monitors red blood cell (anemia is common), white blood cell, and platelet levels.
    *   **Blood Chemistry:** Checks kidney function (BUN, creatinine), albumin, calcium (high levels cause fatigue), LDH, and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M). High LDH and B2M often indicate more advanced disease.
    *   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP):** Detects abnormal monoclonal antibodies (M protein).
    *   **Immunofixation Electrophoresis (IFE):** Identifies the type of M-protein (IgG, IgA, etc.).
    *   **Serum Free Light Chain Assay (SFLC):** Detects and quantifies free light chains; a high ratio suggests myeloma. Important for diagnosis and monitoring, especially for patients with light chain or non-secretory myeloma.

*   **Urine Tests:** Check for myeloma protein (Bence Jones protein).

*   **Bone Marrow Tests:** Determine plasma cell percentage and identify genetic abnormalities.

*   **Imaging:** PET/CT scans help predict outcomes; higher tumor volume before treatment is associated with earlier progression. MRI is often used for evaluating potential spinal cord compression or the extent of bone disease. A skeletal survey (X-rays) is still sometimes used initially or for monitoring bone disease.

### 3. Managing Complications

*   **Kidney Impairment:** Bortezomib-based therapies can sometimes help patients on dialysis regain kidney function.
*   **Infections:** Multiple myeloma and its treatments increase infection risk. Recommended vaccinations (pneumococcal, influenza, COVID-19) are crucial. Prophylactic medications include antivirals (e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir) to prevent shingles. IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) can also help prevent infections.
*   **Neuropathy:** Nerve damage, often from drugs like bortezomib. Dose adjustments or switching medications can help. Pain management includes medications, physical, or occupational therapy.
*   **Bone Pain/Lesions:** Pain can be managed with medication. Bisphosphonates (e.g., Zoledronic acid) and denosumab are given to prevent *future* bone damage and reduce fracture risk, in addition to potentially helping with pain. Bone lesions may also be treated with radiation.
*   **Fatigue:** Very common. Managing anemia, adequate rest, and gentle exercise can help.

### 4. Support and Resources

*   **Patient Navigation Centers:** Offer emotional support and resources.
*   **Myeloma Mentors:** Connect with experienced patients and caregivers.
*   **Education Hubs:** Access webinars, videos, and brochures.
*   **Financial Assistance:** Explore resources for treatment costs and insurance. The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) provide resources.
*   **Support Groups:** Connect with fellow patients and caregivers. The International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) and CancerCare offer support groups.
*   **Myeloma UK:** Research strategy focuses on prevention, personalized treatments, and supportive care.
*   **Racial Disparities:** Be aware of racial and socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis and treatment.
*   **Caregiver Support:** Caregivers play a crucial role; seek resources specifically for them.

### 5. Important Considerations

*   **Quality of Life:** Patient-reported symptoms (fatigue, pain, QOL) affect survival. Discuss *all* symptoms with your healthcare team.

*   **Clinical Trials:** Consider clinical trials, especially for relapsed/refractory disease or high-risk features. Search ClinicalTrials.gov or consult organizations like the MMRF or IMF.

*   **Referral Timing:** Early referral to a specialist is beneficial for access to the latest knowledge, diagnostics, and treatments.
