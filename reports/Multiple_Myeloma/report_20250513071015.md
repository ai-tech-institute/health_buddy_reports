# Understanding Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families

Multiple myeloma isn't curable yet, but new treatments are helping people live longer and better. This summary provides the latest information to help you and your loved ones navigate this journey.

## What is Multiple Myeloma?

*   **The Basics:** Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Cancerous plasma cells multiply uncontrollably, crowding out healthy blood cells and producing abnormal proteins (M-proteins) that can damage organs and weaken bones.
*   **Symptoms to Watch For:** Early symptoms can be subtle. Active myeloma (requiring treatment) is often identified by the acronym **CRAB**:
    *   **C**alcium elevation (high calcium levels in the blood)
    *   **R**enal dysfunction (kidney problems)
    *   **A**nemia (low red blood cell count, causing fatigue)
    *   **B**one lesions (bone pain, fractures)
    *   **Other symptoms:**
        *   Fatigue
        *   Frequent infections: Due to healthy blood cells being crowded out and impaired immune function.
        *   Weight loss: Can be due to the systemic effects of cancer.
        *   Extreme thirst, frequent urination, dehydration, confusion, numbness, or weakness: Can be related to high calcium levels (hypercalcemia) or kidney problems, both linked to myeloma activity.

## How is Multiple Myeloma Diagnosed?

Diagnosis involves:

*   **Blood and Urine Tests:** Checking cell counts, kidney function, calcium levels, M-proteins, and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M). These tests also monitor treatment effectiveness, detect relapse, and identify potential side effects.
*   **Bone Marrow Exam:** Determining the percentage of plasma cells and identifying genetic changes (FISH panel).
*   **Imaging Tests:** X-rays, MRI, CT scans, or PET scans to reveal bone damage.

## Understanding Myeloma Staging and Risk

*   **Staging:** Myeloma stage (1 to 3) indicates disease aggressiveness. The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) uses serum beta-2 microglobulin and serum albumin levels.
*   **Genetic Risk:** Genetic testing (FISH panel) on bone marrow identifies high-risk disease, influencing treatment. Examples of high-risk genetic abnormalities include translocations t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), deletion 17p, and gain 1q.

## Treatment Journey: Understanding the Phases

The typical treatment journey involves distinct phases:

1.  **Induction:** Initial therapy to rapidly reduce myeloma cells.
2.  **Consolidation:** Intensifying treatment (e.g., stem cell transplant) to deepen the response.
3.  **Maintenance:** Long-term therapy to sustain remission and prevent relapse.

## Treatment Advancements: What's New?

Treatment is increasingly personalized. Definitions:
*   **Relapsed Myeloma:** Cancer has returned after a period of remission.
*   **Refractory Myeloma:** Cancer has not responded to treatment or has progressed while on treatment.

Here's a look at recent advancements:

*   **Monoclonal Antibodies:** Target proteins on myeloma cells.
    *   **Daratumumab (Darzalex)** and **isatuximab (Sarclisa)** are often added to standard combinations for both newly diagnosed (NDMM) and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
*   **Bispecific Antibodies:** Redirect your T cells (immune cells) to kill myeloma cells. Used in RRMM.
    *   **Teclistamab (Tecvayli)** and **Elranatamab (Elrexfio)** target BCMA (on myeloma cells) and CD3 (on T-cells).
    *   **Talquetamab (Talvey)** targets GPRC5D (on myeloma cells) and CD3 (on T-cells).
        *   **Important:** Can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Expect hospitalization for monitoring. Increased infection risk.
*   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** Your T cells are modified to recognize and destroy myeloma cells.
    *   **Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel/Abecma)** and **ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel/Carvykti)** are FDA-approved *for specific relapsed/refractory settings*, typically after at least four or five prior lines of therapy including an IMiD, a PI, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Eligibility depends on prior *types* of therapies and *number* of prior lines.
        *   **The Process:** Cell collection, manufacturing time, chemotherapy conditioning, and infusion.
        *   **Important:** Can cause CRS and ICANS, requiring hospitalization and monitoring. Risk of prolonged low blood counts and infections.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Combining drugs is common.
    *   A common combination is bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd), sometimes with daratumumab or isatuximab.
        *   **Side Effects:** Neuropathy (nerve damage) with bortezomib, blood count issues, fatigue, risk of blood clots with lenalidomide, and steroid side effects (sleep disturbance, increased appetite, mood changes).
*   **Personalized Approaches & MRD Testing:** Treatment tailored to your health, myeloma extent, and genetic subtypes.
    *   **MRD (Measurable Residual Disease) testing:** Achieving MRD negativity (undetectable myeloma cells) is linked to better outcomes. MRD testing assesses the depth of response to treatment and is being studied to potentially guide treatment duration in the future; however, stopping or shortening treatment based solely on MRD status is not yet standard practice and is often part of research protocols.
*   **Maintenance Therapy:** Typically uses drugs like lenalidomide (or others) after initial treatment to keep myeloma under control long-term.

*   **Managing Relapsed/Refractory Myeloma:** Treatment depends on prior therapies, response duration, side effects, your health, and preferences.

## Key Considerations for Patients

*   **Regular Monitoring is Crucial:** Tests are essential for diagnosis, treatment effectiveness, relapse detection and side effects
    *   Undergo genetic testing (FISH panel) on bone marrow at diagnosis and *also at relapse* to identify high-risk disease and guide treatment choices, as the genetic profile can change.
*   **Early Referral:** Consider consulting specialists early for planning and exploring options like clinical trials.
*   **Proactive Side Effect Management:** Discuss potential side effects with your healthcare team and report any new or worsening symptoms promptly.
*   **Supportive Care is Essential:**
    *   **Bone Health:** Use bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid/Zometa) or denosumab (Xgeva) *concurrently* with active myeloma treatment to strengthen bones and prevent skeletal-related events (SREs) like fractures, bone pain requiring radiation, and spinal cord compression. Typical frequency is monthly, but can be less frequent. A potential side effect is osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Strongly recommend a dental check-up and completion of any necessary dental work *before* starting these bone-strengthening medications, and maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental follow-ups *while* on them.
    *   **Infection Risk:** Get vaccinated and consider antiviral prophylaxis. Certain myeloma treatments increase the risk of reactivating the Varicella-Zoster virus (which causes shingles), therefore, antiviral medications like acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir are often prescribed to prevent shingles.
    *   Maintain good nutrition, hydration, and exercise. Seek support groups and patient navigation services.
*   **Understanding Blood Work:** Key tests include:
    *   **CBC (Complete Blood Count):** Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
    *   **CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel):** Kidney and liver function, calcium, and electrolytes.
    *   **SPEP/IFE (Serum Protein Electrophoresis/Immunofixation Electrophoresis):** Detect and identify M-proteins.
    *   **sFLC (Serum Free Light Chain Assay):** Measure kappa and lambda light chains.
    *   High levels of LDH and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) can indicate more advanced disease.

## Clinical Trials: Exploring New Options

Clinical trials test new treatment approaches. Ask your oncologist or search databases like clinicaltrials.gov.

## Patient Resources

Take advantage of the resources available:

*   **Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF)**: Patient navigation, myeloma mentors, educational resources, and support.
*   **International Myeloma Foundation (IMF)**: Information, support groups, and seminars.
*   **Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS)**: Clinical trial support and other resources.
*   Consider connecting with a peer mentor or speaking with an information specialist at these organizations.

**Important Note:** While multiple myeloma is not yet curable, significant progress has been made, and new treatments continue to emerge. The five-year survival rate has steadily increased, and many patients are living longer and with a better quality of life.
