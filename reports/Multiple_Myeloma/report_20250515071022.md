# Understanding Multiple Myeloma: A Guide for Patients and Families

This summary provides the latest information on Multiple Myeloma (MM) to help patients and their loved ones navigate diagnosis, treatment, and living with this disease. We emphasize progress in treatment and the importance of open communication with your healthcare team.

## 1. What is Multiple Myeloma?

*   **Nature of the Disease:** MM is a cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow. These cells produce abnormal antibodies (M proteins) that can damage organs and crowd out healthy blood cells.
*   **Risk Factors:** Older age (60s-70s) is a primary risk factor. Black individuals are diagnosed earlier and more frequently. Family history may also increase risk. *Most* people with MM have none of these risk factors.
*   **Early Detection:** MM may be suspected from routine blood tests showing elevated protein, low blood counts, or kidney problems.
*   **Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM):** An earlier, symptom-free phase with higher M-protein levels. *Standard* SMM is typically monitored closely without immediate treatment ("watch and wait").
    *   **High-Risk SMM:** Defined by specific biomarkers (high free light chain ratio, high bone marrow plasma cell percentage, specific genetic abnormalities) indicating a higher risk of progressing to active MM. These biomarkers reflect a larger burden or more aggressive nature of the abnormal cells, making progression more likely soon. The goal of treating high-risk SMM in clinical trials is to prevent or delay progression to active myeloma, potentially improving long-term outcomes. May be treated in clinical trials to delay progression.

## 2. Recognizing Symptoms and Diagnosis

*   **Common Symptoms (CRAB):** Remember the acronym **CRAB**:
    *   **C**alcium elevation (high blood calcium)
    *   **R**enal insufficiency (kidney problems)
    *   **A**nemia (low red blood cell count)
    *   **B**one lesions (bone pain, fractures)
    Other symptoms include backache, frequent infections, weight loss, and fatigue.
*   **Diagnostic Tests:**
    *   Blood and urine tests (M-protein detection)
    *   Blood chemistry and kidney function assessment
    *   Imaging tests (bone problems)
    *   Bone marrow biopsy (myeloma cells)
*   **Key Blood Tests & What They Mean:**
    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Measures blood cells. Low red blood cells (anemia) are common.
    *   **Blood Chemistry:** Checks kidney function (BUN, creatinine), calcium, electrolytes. High calcium (hypercalcemia) causes fatigue, weakness, and confusion.
    *   **LDH and Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):** Higher levels may indicate more advanced disease. Important prognostic markers used in staging systems (like the International Staging System, ISS, or Revised ISS, R-ISS).
    *   **Quantitative Immunoglobulins:** Measures antibody levels (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM). One type is often high, others low because the abnormal plasma cells crowd out the healthy ones that make normal antibodies. Low normal antibody levels increase the risk of infection.
    *   **Serum Free Light Chain Test:** Measures kappa and lambda light chains. Higher levels may indicate more aggressive disease. The serum-free light chain test is a better predictor of outcome than the amount of M-protein in the blood.
    *   **M Spike:** Measures M protein. The presence of any M spike is abnormal because it reflects the presence of an abnormal clone of plasma cells.
*   **Diagnostic Criteria:** Requires evidence of clonal plasma cells (>10% in bone marrow or a plasma cell tumor) **plus** at least one of the CRAB criteria **or** specific biomarkers of malignancy (Free Light Chain ratio >100, >60% plasma cells in marrow, **or more than one focal lesion identified on MRI**). These findings, even without CRAB symptoms, indicate that the myeloma is active and requires treatment because they show a high burden or aggressive potential of the abnormal plasma cells.

## 3. Understanding Your Treatment Options

Treatment is highly individualized based on factors like age, health, genetic risk, and transplant eligibility. Discuss individual drug side effects and side effects of combinations with your healthcare team, as side effect profiles can overlap or have unique aspects depending on the specific drugs used.

*   **Initial Treatment:** Combination of medications. Examples include RVd (Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, Dexamethasone) or Dara-RVd (Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, Dexamethasone).
*   **Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT):** Typically *autologous* (ASCT) - using your own stem cells. This involves receiving high-dose chemotherapy to kill myeloma cells, followed by infusion of your own stored stem cells to restore bone marrow function. Eligibility depends on age and overall health.
*   **CAR-T Cell Therapy:** Genetically engineered T cells target myeloma cells. Both Ide-cel (Abecma) and Cilta-cel (Carvykti) are FDA-approved. Primarily for relapsed/refractory MM after specific types and numbers of prior therapies, including an IMiD, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Significant side effects: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS: fever, chills, headache, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure), neurotoxicity (confusion, difficulty speaking, tremors, seizures). These are managed by trained healthcare teams, often requiring hospitalization for treatment initiation. Access may be limited due to certified centers and manufacturing slots.
*   **Bispecific Antibodies:** Redirect your T cells to kill myeloma cells. Teclistamab (Tecvayli), Elranatamab (Elrexfio), and Talquetamab (Talvey) are all FDA-approved. Primarily for relapsed/refractory MM, often after specific prior lines of therapy, especially for BCMA-targeted ones like Teclistamab and Elranatamab. Significant side effects: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS: fever, chills, headache, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure), neurotoxicity (confusion, difficulty speaking, tremors, seizures). Talquetamab targets GPRC5D (different from BCMA targets of others), making it valuable for patients whose disease progressed after BCMA-targeted therapies. These therapies also often require initial hospitalization or very close monitoring for side effect management.
*   **Monoclonal Antibody Drug Treatments:** Daratumumab (Darzalex) and Isatuximab (Sarclisa) are significant and now very commonly used *early* in treatment, not solely for relapsed/refractory disease. These drugs bind to the CD38 antigen abundant on myeloma cells. Daratumumab can be administered via IV infusion or subcutaneous injection (faster and more convenient). Increased risk of infection is a common side effect.
*   **Radiation Therapy:** Treats painful or problematic areas affected by myeloma.
*   **Precision Medicine:** Venetoclax is FDA-approved *for patients with the t(11;14) chromosomal translocation* who have received at least one prior therapy. Genetic testing (FISH) is required. Potential side effects include low blood counts (neutropenia), diarrhea, and nausea.
*   **Maintenance Therapy:** Lenalidomide is common *after* ASCT or for transplant-ineligible patients after induction. Daratumumab is often added. Because MM is often not curable with initial treatment alone, maintenance therapy helps suppress the disease to maintain remission for longer. Typical duration is often continued until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.
*   **Common Side Effects by Drug Class:** Discuss potential side effects of each drug class and combination with your doctor. Examples include:
    *   Proteasome Inhibitors (e.g., Bortezomib): Neuropathy (nerve damage causing pain or numbness)
    *   IMiDs (e.g., Lenalidomide): Blood count suppression, fatigue, increased risk of blood clots (DVT)
    *   Anti-CD38 antibodies (e.g., Daratumumab): Infusion reactions, increased risk of infections
    *   Steroids (e.g., Dexamethasone): Sleep disturbance, increased appetite, mood changes

## 4. Tracking Your Progress: Understanding Test Results Over Time

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Monitor for anemia (low red blood cells), which may require transfusions or medication adjustments.
*   **Blood Chemistry:** Track calcium levels; persistent high calcium may indicate disease progression or require treatment.
*   **Serum Free Light Chain Test:** Rising free light chains may indicate the disease is becoming more active.
*   **M Spike:** Increasing M protein levels can indicate relapse or progression.
*   **MRI Results:** Used to monitor changes in lesions. Reports are provided by a Radiologist with an interpretation for your physician.
*   **Genetic Testing:**
    *   Types: Cytogenetics (looks at the whole chromosome set) and FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization - looks for specific, targeted abnormalities).
    *   Important abnormalities: del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), 1q gain (higher risk); t(11;14), t(6;14) (standard/intermediate risk).
    *   Why track them? Prognosis, guiding treatment (e.g., Venetoclax for t(11;14), choice of induction therapy, timing of ASCT).
*   **Imaging Reports:** X-rays, CT scans, PET/CT scans, and MRI are used in MM for checking for bone lesions and extramedullary disease. PET/CT scans are particularly useful for detecting metabolically active disease. Imaging is used both for diagnosis and for monitoring response to treatment or detecting progression. A Radiologist provides reports with interpretations for your physician, including location, size, and number of lesions.
*   **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing:** Advanced testing looks for very small numbers of remaining myeloma cells after treatment. Achieving MRD negativity is a goal often associated with better long-term outcomes, and testing can sometimes help guide treatment duration.

## 5. Living Well with Multiple Myeloma

*   **Improved Prognosis:** Treatments have significantly improved survival rates. The five-year survival rate has increased to over 62%. This number is an average and can vary significantly based on individual factors like age, overall health, disease stage, and genetic risk factors.
*   **Patient Empowerment:** Be active in your health, ask questions, and make lifestyle changes.
*   **Exercise:** Resistance training maintains bone density.
*   **Support System:** Strong support from family, friends, and employers is crucial.
*   **Managing Relapse:** MM is often relapsing-remitting. Relapse means the return or progression of the disease after treatment. If relapse occurs, there are usually many effective treatment options available for subsequent lines of therapy, which are chosen based on prior treatments, disease characteristics, and patient factors. Understand relapse management.
*   **Focus on well-being**: Personalized treatment plans that balance efficacy with quality of life are essential.

## 6. Where to Find Support

*   **Major Organizations:** Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF), and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) are primary resources.
*   **Living with High-Risk Multiple Myeloma Group:** HRMM@imfsupport.org
*   **Multiple Myeloma Support Group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK):** Virtual support for MSK patients.

*   **Local Resources:** Local cancer centers and hospitals often have their own support groups or can connect patients with resources.
*   **HealthTree by Myeloma Crowd:** Patient-led community.

## 7. Emerging Therapies

*   **Allogeneic CAR T-cell products:** These are being developed as a potential "off-the-shelf" (more readily available) option compared to current autologous CAR-T therapies.
*   **CAR T-cell products targeting both GPRC5D and BCMA / Trispecifics:** These aim to overcome resistance by targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.
*   **CELMoDs:** Related to IMiDs but designed for improved efficacy and safety.
*   **Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs):** e.g., Belantamab mafodotin (current status is complex but has been used in relapsed disease)
*   **Novel Oral Agents and Combinations**
    *   **Note:** These therapies are primarily being studied *in clinical trials* and are not yet FDA-approved for general use, unless otherwise noted. Clinical trials provide access to potentially more effective treatments not yet widely available and contribute to advancing myeloma research. Discuss these options with your healthcare team, especially a myeloma specialist.

## 8. Addressing Disparities in Myeloma Care

*   **Racial and socioeconomic disparities:** Exist in myeloma diagnosis and treatment.
*   **Delayed diagnosis and reduced access to therapies:** Affect African American and Latino American patients.
*   **Actionable Steps:** Seek patient advocacy resources, be aware of potential biases, ask about access to clinical trials, ensure robust insurance coverage if possible, and seek evaluation and treatment from a myeloma specialist whenever possible. Access to expert knowledge and experience is strongly associated with improved outcomes.
