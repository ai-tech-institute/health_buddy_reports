## Understanding Recent Advances in Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

This summary highlights key updates in MS research and practical strategies for patients and caregivers. Discuss these developments and any concerns with your neurologist or healthcare team to determine the best course of action for your individual situation.

### 1. Earlier and More Accurate Diagnosis

*   **Revised McDonald Criteria (2024):** The McDonald Criteria are internationally recognized guidelines used by neurologists to diagnose multiple sclerosis. The 2024 update incorporates a biomarker-driven, molecular approach. Specific patterns in brain MRI scans, such as central vein sign (a marker related to veins in MS lesions) and paramagnetic rim lesions (a marker indicating active inflammation), along with lab measures such as kappa free light chains (proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood that can be elevated in MS), may allow for earlier and more accurate MS diagnoses, even before overt clinical symptoms appear. This enables diagnosis based on biological evidence rather than solely relying on clinical manifestations. Discuss with your neurologist how these changes might affect your diagnosis or monitoring.
*   **Radiological-Only Onset:** The updated criteria may help diagnose individuals with radiological-only onset (signs of disease on MRI but no clear neurological symptoms) and those with atypical clinical presentations, who might have been missed previously.
*   **Blood Biomarkers:** Currently, blood biomarkers for MS diagnosis are primarily used in research settings to improve diagnostic accuracy and earlier detection. Research is ongoing to translate these findings into routine clinical practice.
*   **Blood test to predict MS Activity:** Higher Z-scores in NfL (Neurofilament Light chain) blood tests can indicate increased disease activity in the following year, and that changes of NfL values under different therapies revealed the extent to which their MS was responding to therapy. Neurofilament Light chain (NfL) is a protein released into the blood when nerve cells are damaged. Higher levels can indicate more nerve damage. Track your NfL scores over time and discuss significant changes with your doctor.

### 2. Emerging Treatments and Therapies

*   **Tolebrutinib (Investigational):** The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to tolebrutinib for non-relapsing secondary-progressive MS (nrSPMS). Tolebrutinib is an *investigational* oral medication *not yet FDA approved* that delayed disability progression in a Phase III study. It is crucial to understand that tolebrutinib is still under investigation and is not a currently approved treatment option outside of clinical trials. Tolebrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, able to penetrate the brain and modulate B cells and microglia. While common side effects observed in trials include upper respiratory tract infection and headache, it is important to discuss the full side effect profile, including any potential risks related to liver function or infections, with your doctor if considering this treatment in a trial setting.
*   **Mavenclad:** The oral disease-modifying therapy Mavenclad (cladribine) shows benefits when taken after a first clinical demyelinating event, which is an episode of neurological symptoms caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin (protective covering of nerves) in the brain or spinal cord. This first event is often referred to as Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). Mavenclad is approved for relapsing forms of MS and is now being considered for use after a first demyelinating event to potentially prevent progression to definite MS. Discuss with your neurologist if Mavenclad might be a suitable early intervention option for you, especially after a diagnosis of CIS. Important side effects to discuss with your doctor include lymphopenia, potential for infections, and the possible risk of malignancy.
*   **Remyelination Strategies:** Several research groups are exploring diverse strategies to promote remyelination, including antibody therapies, growth factors, specific drug targets. These strategies aim to repair damaged myelin and potentially reverse some neurological deficits. Research into remyelination is very promising, but these therapies are still in the experimental phase and not yet ready for clinical use. Patients should follow updates from reputable MS research organizations for future developments.
*   **Vidofludimus calcium (Investigational):** Vidofludimus calcium, a Nurr1 activator, is *under investigation* and shows promise for patients without relapses and could address neurodegenerative aspects of MS.

### 3. Prioritizing Overall Health and Lifestyle

*   **Overall Health Impact:** Attending to overall health is crucial in managing MS. High blood pressure and high levels of "bad" cholesterol are associated with decreased grey matter volume in the brain.
*   **Depression and Fatigue:** Reducing depressive symptoms can improve fatigue impact in people with MS.
*   **Diet:** Consider adopting a dietary pattern like the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and healthy fats, and has been associated with various health benefits. Good sources of Vitamin D include fatty fish, fortified dairy or plant-based milks, and egg yolks. B vitamins are found in whole grains, meat, eggs, and leafy green vegetables. Antioxidants are plentiful in berries, colorful fruits and vegetables, and nuts. Eating a diet rich in these nutrients and high in fiber from leafy green vegetables, berries, whole grains like quinoa and oats can help patients feel better, while maximizing their energy and supporting healthy bladder and bowel function.
*   **Exercise:** Regular movement, even in small amounts, can help maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and balance. Gentle exercises like seated yoga or tai chi, walking, swimming, or water aerobics can improve coordination. Track your exercise frequency, duration, and perceived exertion to identify what works best for you.
*   **Inflammation:** Inflammation outside of the brain, caused by infections, smoking, and obesity, could contribute to the progression of MS.

### 4. Practical Solutions for Daily Living

*   **Home Adjustments:** Simple modifications can support independence and prevent accidents. This includes:
    *   Bathrooms: Install grab bars in the shower and near the toilet, use non-slip mats, consider a shower chair.
    *   Entryways: Install ramps or handrails for steps, ensure adequate lighting, remove tripping hazards like loose rugs.
    *   Smart Technology: Use voice-activated assistants for lights, temperature control, and entertainment systems; consider smart home devices that can be controlled remotely.
*   **Energy Management:** Pacing tasks, scheduling demanding activities when energy is highest, and using mobility aids can minimize strain and extend endurance.
*   **Seasonal Considerations:** MS symptoms can worsen during extreme weather. Managing fatigue in summer heat and stiffness in colder months is essential.

### 5. Understanding MS Reports and Blood Work

*   Blood tests are not used to diagnose MS directly, but they are essential to rule out other conditions that can mimic MS symptoms, such as infections, vitamin deficiencies, or other autoimmune diseases. Therefore, blood tests are a routine part of the diagnostic process to ensure accurate diagnosis.
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** A complete blood count (CBC), which measures different types of blood cells, can help rule out anemia (low red blood cell count) or infections/inflammation (high white blood cell count) that could mimic MS symptoms.
*   **NMO-IgG Blood Test:** The NMO-IgG blood test is specifically used to differentiate MS from Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), a condition with some overlapping symptoms but requiring different treatments.
*   **Kappa Free Light Chains:** Along with advanced imaging, these laboratory measures may enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses of MS, even before overt clinical symptoms appear.

### 6. MS Support and Awareness

*   **MS Awareness Month:** MSAAâ€™s campaign focuses on education, empowerment, and support for newly diagnosed individuals.
*   **Support Resources:** National MS Society ([www.nationalmssociety.org](www.nationalmssociety.org), phone number available on website) and MS Canada ([mscanada.ca](mscanada.ca), phone number available on website) offer personalized information, resources, support groups, and programs for individuals with MS, their families, and caregivers.
*   **Peer Support:** Connecting with others facing similar challenges can provide emotional support and practical advice through online MS forums, local MS support groups (often listed on the National MS Society or MS Canada websites), or through hospital-based support programs.

### 7. Other Important Points

*   **UTIs:** Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in people with MS due to bladder dysfunction. Staying well-hydrated, practicing good hygiene, and promptly reporting symptoms of UTI to your doctor are important preventative measures.
*   **Stopping DMTs (Disease-Modifying Therapies):** Stopping DMTs, even if you feel stable, can significantly increase the risk of MS relapses and disease progression. Decisions about stopping or changing DMTs should *always* be made in close consultation with your neurologist, carefully weighing the risks and benefits.
*   **Pregnancy:** A large study found that most treatments for MS don't increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, or major congenital anomalies. If you are planning a pregnancy, it is crucial to discuss your MS medications with your neurologist and obstetrician. Many DMTs are considered safe during pregnancy, and careful planning can help ensure both maternal and fetal health.
*   **Machine Learning:** Researchers are using advanced computer techniques like machine learning to better predict MS progression and personalize treatment plans in the future. This could lead to more targeted and effective therapies.

This summary provides an overview of recent advancements in MS research. It is crucial for patients and their loved ones to discuss these developments and any concerns with their neurologists or healthcare team to determine the most appropriate course of action for their individual situation.
