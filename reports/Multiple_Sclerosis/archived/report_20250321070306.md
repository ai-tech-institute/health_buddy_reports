# Multiple Sclerosis: What's New & Important for You (October 2024)

Here's a concise update on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) research and information relevant to patients and their families.

## 1. Promising New Treatments & Clinical Trials

*   **Tolebrutinib: A Potential Breakthrough?** Tolebrutinib, a **Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor**, is currently in Phase 3 trials and designed to reduce inflammation by targeting immune cells in the brain and spinal cord. BTK inhibitors may offer a different mechanism of action compared to existing DMTs, potentially targeting inflammation in the brain more directly. The FDA has granted it "Breakthrough Therapy" designation for non-relapsing secondary-progressive MS (nrSPMS). This designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious conditions where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy, but does not guarantee approval.  **Action:** Visit [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and search for 'Tolebrutinib AND Multiple Sclerosis AND Phase 3'. Filter by 'Recruiting' or 'Active, not recruiting' to find potentially relevant trials. Discuss with your neurologist if participating in a clinical trial might be appropriate for you.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   What are the potential benefits of Tolebrutinib compared to my current treatment?
        *   What are the possible side effects and how will they be managed?
        *   Am I eligible for any of the Phase 3 clinical trials?

*   **Ublituximab (BriumviÂ®): A New Option?** Ublituximab is an **anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody**, similar to ocrelizumab and rituximab, and received FDA approval in the United States in 2022 for relapsing forms of MS. It is administered via intravenous (IV) infusion, similar to ocrelizumab. In Australia, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) will discuss its inclusion on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in May 2025 for adults with relapsing-remitting MS. The PBAC makes a recommendation, and the Australian Government makes the final decision about PBS inclusion. The PBS is Australia's government program that *subsidizes* the cost of medicines (making them more affordable). Inclusion on the PBS would significantly improve access to ublituximab for Australian patients. **Action:** Discuss potential side effects (infusion reactions are common, especially with the first infusion; increased risk of upper respiratory infections is also possible) with your doctor.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   How does Ublituximab compare to other anti-CD20 therapies?
        *   What is the infusion schedule and what can I expect during the infusion?
        *   What are the long-term risks and benefits of Ublituximab?

*   **Cladribine (Mavenclad): Convenient Oral Treatment.** Cladribine is an **oral Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT)**, offering self-administration with a two-year course of tablets. This involves short courses of tablets in year one and year two, with no treatment in between. Recommended by NICE in the UK for active relapsing-remitting MS. Cladribine is FDA approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS; however, it's not always considered a first-line treatment. **Action:** Discuss risks (lymphopenia, pregnancy contraindication, increased risk of infections, potential for liver problems (rare), and the need for careful monitoring of blood counts) and benefits with your neurologist.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   Am I a good candidate for Cladribine based on my MS disease activity and other health conditions?
        *   What blood tests will be required during and after treatment?
        *   How long will the effects of Cladribine last?

*   **Myelin Repair Trial: Hope for Remyelination.** A Phase 2 trial in Cambridge is testing a combination of clemastine fumarate (an antihistamine commonly used for allergies) and metformin (a repurposed drug initially developed for type 2 diabetes and with neuroprotective properties) to boost myelin repair in relapsing MS. Results are expected in late 2025. **Action:** Set a reminder to check for results updates in late 2025, as trial result timelines can shift. A more precise search than a general web search is "NCT[trial registry number] ReBUILD MS" on clinicaltrials.gov once the registry number is made public.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   What are the potential mechanisms of action of the drugs being tested in the ReBUILD trial?
        *   If the trial is successful, when might this treatment become available?
        *   Are there any other myelin repair strategies currently being investigated?

*   **Obexelimab (Anti-CD19 Antibody): New Study.** Zenas BioPharma is recruiting for the Phase 2 MoonStone study to evaluate obexelimab, an anti-CD19 antibody for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). **Action:** Search "Obexelimab MoonStone study" on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) or the Zenas BioPharma website for eligibility and locations, looking for trial locations that are geographically convenient.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   How does an anti-CD19 antibody differ from anti-CD20 therapies?
        *   What are the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the MoonStone study?
        *   What are the potential risks and benefits of participating in this study?

## 2. Understanding Your DMTs

*   **Stopping DMTs: Proceed with Caution.** Stopping DMTs *without medical supervision* is strongly discouraged. A study suggests that stopping DMTs after long-term stability *may* increase relapse risk or disability progression. **Action:** *Never* stop DMTs without consulting your neurologist to weigh the individual risks and benefits.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   What are the potential risks of stopping my DMT in my specific case?
        *   What factors should be considered when making a decision about stopping DMTs?
        *   How will my MS be monitored if I decide to stop treatment?

*   **Ocrelizumab & Pregnancy: Ongoing Research.** Research is exploring ocrelizumab use during pregnancy and infant outcomes. Current guidelines often recommend discontinuing ocrelizumab before planned pregnancy. **Action:** Women with MS should discuss family planning thoroughly with their neurologist *well in advance* of trying to conceive, as decisions about DMTs and pregnancy often require planning.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   What are the potential risks of using Ocrelizumab during pregnancy?
        *   How long before trying to conceive should I stop Ocrelizumab?
        *   What are the alternative treatment options during pregnancy?

## 3. Diagnostic Advancements (Expected Updates in 2025)

*   **Updated McDonald Criteria (2025):** Expect refinements to the McDonald diagnostic criteria (the global standards for diagnosing MS) in 2025, incorporating advanced imaging and blood biomarkers for earlier and more accurate diagnoses, potentially leading to earlier treatment and better outcomes. **Action:** Check the websites of the National MS Society (US), MS Society of Canada, and the MS Trust (UK) for patient-friendly explanations once the updates are published. Sign up for newsletters or email updates from these organizations to be notified when the updated criteria are released and explained.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   How might the updated McDonald criteria affect my diagnosis or treatment plan?
        *   What new imaging techniques or blood biomarkers are being considered for inclusion in the criteria?
        *   Where can I find reliable information about the updated criteria?

## 4. Managing Symptoms & Health

*   **Metabolic Syndrome & MS:** Growing evidence suggests that metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, abdominal obesity) can worsen MS. **Action:** Adopt a low-fat, high-fiber diet, and exercise regularly. Focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats like olive oil. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated and trans fats. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise most days of the week, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling. Incorporate strength training exercises 2-3 times per week, as tolerated.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   What are my specific risk factors for metabolic syndrome?
        *   What dietary and exercise recommendations are best suited for me?
        *   How often should I be screened for metabolic syndrome?

*   **Vitamin D is Key:** Ensure adequate Vitamin D levels. **Action:** Ask your doctor to check your Vitamin D level. Discuss appropriate supplementation if you are deficient, as maintaining adequate Vitamin D may have benefits for MS.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   What is my current Vitamin D level?
        *   What is the recommended Vitamin D intake for someone with MS?
        *   What are the best ways to increase my Vitamin D levels?

*   **Cognitive Impairment:** If you experience memory or thinking difficulties, discuss this with your doctor. Cognitive rehabilitation and strategies (cognitive training exercises, memory aids, and organizational techniques) can help.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   What are the signs of cognitive impairment in MS?
        *   What cognitive assessments are available?
        *   What cognitive rehabilitation strategies would be most beneficial for me?

*   **COVID-19 & MS Risk:** A study suggests a *possible* increased MS risk in people hospitalized for COVID-19. More research is needed.

    *   **Key Questions to Ask Your Doctor:**
        *   Am I at increased risk of developing MS due to a previous COVID-19 infection?
        *   What precautions should I take to minimize my risk of COVID-19?

## 5. Living Well & Finding Support

*   **Holistic Care is Essential:** Focus on integrating physical, occupational, and mental health therapies, including mindfulness, exercise, and diet.
*   **Optimize Your Environment:** Arrange your home and office for efficiency and safety.
*   **Connect with Support Groups:** Utilize in-person groups, online forums, and social media communities like the MS Trust Facebook Group.
*   **Adapt to Seasonal Changes:** Manage fatigue in summer and stiffness in winter.
