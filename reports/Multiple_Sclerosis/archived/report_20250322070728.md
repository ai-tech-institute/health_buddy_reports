## Recent Advances in Multiple Sclerosis: A Guide for Patients & Families (2025)

**Important Note:** This summary provides general information about recent MS research and is not medical advice. Always consult with your healthcare provider for personalized guidance regarding your MS diagnosis and treatment.

This summary highlights the latest developments in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), focusing on practical solutions and important information to empower patients and their families.

### 1. Earlier Diagnosis: Updated Criteria & New Tools

**Understanding the Updated McDonald Criteria (2024/2025):**

The criteria used to diagnose MS have been revised, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Key changes include:

*   **Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS):** If an MRI scan shows signs suggestive of MS (lesions in the brain or spinal cord), *even if you haven't experienced typical MS symptoms*, you *may* now be diagnosed with MS in specific cases.
*   **Optic Nerve:** Damage to the optic nerve is now considered a key location for diagnostic purposes.
*   **Dissemination in Time (DIT):** Previously, a diagnosis required evidence of MS activity happening at more than one point in time. This is now sometimes waived under certain conditions.
*   **Dissemination in Space (DIS):** This refers to having evidence of MS lesions in more than one area of the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
*   **Advanced Imaging & Lab Tests:** Specific MRI markers (central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions) and lab tests (kappa free light chains, CSF-specific immunoglobulin synthesis) can further support an MS diagnosis.

**Key Changes in McDonald Criteria**

| Feature                | Previous Criteria                               | Updated Criteria                                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) | Typically not diagnosed with MS        | MS diagnosis possible in some RIS cases with DIS on MRI, even without symptoms. |
| Optic Nerve            | Considered, but not emphasized              | Emphasized as a key location for diagnostic purposes                            |
| Dissemination in Time (DIT)  | Required evidence of activity at >1 timepoint | May be waived under certain MRI conditions                                      |
| Dissemination in Space (DIS)  | Required evidence of lesions in >1 location   | Continues to be a key factor, with specific MRI features considered. |

**Blood Biomarkers: A Potential Early Warning System?**

Research suggests that specific blood tests, like serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP), and a distinct pattern of autoantibodies, *may* help diagnose MS.

*   **Availability:** Discuss their availability with your doctor.
*   **Interpreting Results:** Elevated levels *may* indicate an increased risk of developing MS, warranting closer monitoring. This closer monitoring might involve more frequent neurological examinations (e.g., every 3-6 months), repeat MRI scans at regular intervals (e.g., every 6 months to a year), or ongoing blood biomarker testing to track changes over time.

**Actionable Implications:**

*   **If you have had an MRI showing unexplained lesions**, or have symptoms suggestive of MS but haven't received a definitive diagnosis, **discuss the updated McDonald Criteria and blood biomarker testing with your neurologist**. Early diagnosis is key to starting treatment sooner.

### 2. Emerging Treatments & Therapies: Hope for the Future

**Tolebrutinib:**

*   This medication has received "Breakthrough Therapy" designation from the FDA for non-relapsing secondary-progressive MS (nrSPMS).
*   **Clinical Trial Results:** Phase III trials have shown promising results in reducing disability progression in nrSPMS.
*   **Important Note:** Tolebrutinib is taken orally. Be sure to discuss potential side effects with your neurologist. Common side effects associated with BTK inhibitors can include liver enzyme elevations (requiring regular monitoring), increased risk of infections (like upper respiratory infections), and gastrointestinal issues. Discuss the specific side effect profile of tolebrutinib with your neurologist.
*   **Availability:** Keep an eye on FDA announcements for potential approval.

**BTK Inhibitors:**

*   Beyond tolebrutinib, other BTK inhibitors like evobrutinib and fenebrutinib are in late-stage clinical trials for MS.
*   **Actionable Implications:** Talk to your doctor to learn more about them.

**CAR T-cell Therapy:**

*   This therapy targets CD19 and is being investigated as a novel treatment for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).
*   **Status:** Currently in Phase I/II clinical trials (early stages).
*   **Important Note:** It's experimental and not widely available outside of clinical trials.
*   **Actionable Implications:** Not widely available yet.

**Remyelination Therapies (e.g., PIPE-307):**

*   These therapies aim to repair myelin, the protective coating around nerve fibers.
*   **PIPE-307:** This oral therapy is in Phase 2 trials for RRMS.
*   **Actionable Implications:** Not widely available yet.

**Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):**

*   Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is being explored in clinical trials to investigate its potential to reduce inflammation and modulate the immune system in MS.
*   **Actionable Implications:** Discuss VNS with your doctor.

**Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs):**

*   **Ublituximab (Briumvi):** Approved for relapsing forms of MS. *Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody*. Administered via intravenous infusion.
*   **Ofatumumab (Kesimpta):** Approved for relapsing forms of MS. *Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody*. Administered via subcutaneous self-injection.
*   **Mavenclad:** Used for highly active relapsing MS and after a first episode suggestive of MS. *Purine nucleoside analog*. It is an oral medication given in short courses.

**Actionable Implications:**

*   **Discuss these emerging therapies and clinical trial options with your neurologist** to see if you are a suitable candidate.
*   **Find MS clinical trials:** Search for "MS clinical trials" on clinicaltrials.gov or the National MS Society website.

### 3. Managing MS Fatigue: A Personalized Approach

Fatigue is a common and debilitating MS symptom. A multidisciplinary approach is essential:

*   **Physical Therapy:** Learn energy-saving techniques and develop exercise programs.
*   **Occupational Therapy:** Simplify tasks.
*   **Psychological Interventions:** Stress management, relaxation training, support groups and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
*   **Mental Exercises:** Puzzles and therapy may help cognitive fatigue.
*   **Gamified Apps:** Explore gamified apps for energy management: Search app stores for "MS fatigue apps" or "energy management apps" to find tools that may help you track and manage your energy levels. Consider factors like user reviews and features when selecting an app.

**COMBO-MS Study:**

*   This study found that combination therapy wasn't statistically better than individual therapies for fatigue overall.
*   **Modafinil:** A medication sometimes used to treat excessive sleepiness, *may* be helpful for those with significant sleepiness contributing to their fatigue.

**Actionable Implications:**

*   **Develop a personalized fatigue management plan** with your healthcare team.
*   **Address underlying factors** like sleep disturbances, vitamin deficiencies, and mood disorders.

### 4. Lifestyle & Well-being: Taking Control

*   **Healthy Diet:** Focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, such as the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, and limits red meat and processed foods.
*   **Regular Physical Activity:** Aim for 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days (e.g., swimming, walking, yoga). Adapt exercise to your abilities and fatigue levels.
*   **Alternative Medicine:** Discuss options like meditation, yoga, massage, acupuncture, and cannabis with your healthcare team.
*   **Oral Cannabis Extract (OCE):** Discuss the potential benefits and risks of using medical cannabis with your doctor.
*   **Actionable Implications:** A healthy lifestyle plays a crucial role in managing MS.

### 5. Factors Influencing MS: Staying Informed

*   **Pregnancy:** Pregnancy often leads to a temporary reduction in MS relapses, but the risk *may* increase after delivery. Discuss family planning with your neurologist.
*   **COVID-19:** A Swedish study indicated that individuals *hospitalized* with COVID-19 showed an increased risk of developing MS compared to individuals who were not hospitalized with COVID-19. This suggests a potential link between *severe* COVID-19 infection and MS risk. The absolute increase in risk is still being studied.
*   **Gut Microbiome & EBV:** Future research *may* lead to dietary interventions targeting the gut microbiome or antiviral therapies targeting EBV.

### 6. Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs): Key to Long-Term Management

*   **Early and Aggressive Treatment:** Aggressive treatment with DMTs as early as possible can lower the relapse rate and slow the formation of new lesions.
*   **De-escalation of DMTs:** It is critical to understand that DMT de-escalation is **not a routine recommendation** and is considered **only in very specific, carefully selected patients** under strict neurological supervision. For the vast majority of individuals with MS, continuing DMT indefinitely remains the standard of care to manage disease activity. De-escalation is a complex decision that should **only ever** be made in close consultation with a neurologist, and is not appropriate for most patients with MS.

### 7. Understanding Blood Work: What to Expect

*   **Blood tests** are often the first step in evaluating MS symptoms.
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Can point to anemia, vasculitis, and infection.
*   **Thyroid Hormone Levels:** Testing may be part of the diagnostic process.
*   **Vitamin D Levels:** Deficiency is common in MS and linked to disease activity.
*   **Inflammatory Markers (CRP, ESR):** Help rule out other inflammatory conditions.

It's important to note that while blood tests are a valuable part of the initial evaluation for MS symptoms, they are often used to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms or to monitor overall health and vitamin levels, rather than to directly diagnose MS itself. MS diagnosis is primarily based on clinical evaluation and MRI findings.

### 8. Clinical Trials: Contributing to Future Advances

*   **Participating in clinical trials is crucial for advancing MS research and treatment.**
*   **Find and learn more about MS clinical trials:** clinicaltrials.gov, the National MS Society's website, or the MS International Federation's website.
