            # Latest on Multiple Sclerosis: Research & Practical Insights

This summary highlights recent advancements in MS research, offering practical insights and support for patients and their loved ones.

## 1. Earlier and More Accurate Diagnosis

*   **Proposed Refinements to McDonald Criteria (Expected 2025):** The McDonald Criteria are guidelines used to diagnose MS. Researchers are working on incorporating biomarkers (measurable indicators) like the central vein sign (seen on MRI), paramagnetic rim lesions (another MRI lesion), and kappa free light chains (proteins in spinal fluid) into these criteria. These *proposed* refinements aim for earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Earlier diagnosis of MS is crucial as it allows for quicker initiation of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which can improve long-term outcomes and potentially slow disease progression. *Note: These are proposed refinements expected to be published in 2025 and are not yet the currently used diagnostic criteria.*
*   **Genetic and Symptom-Based Risk Scores:** A predictive model combining genetic and symptom-based risk scores from electronic health records demonstrates high accuracy in identifying individuals at risk in research settings (91-99%). This model also considers ancestry for a more refined prediction. In the future, such models could help identify individuals who might benefit from closer monitoring or earlier preventative strategies, although these applications are still being researched. *This predictive model is currently in the research phase and may not yet be available for clinical use, but represents a promising step towards personalized risk assessment for MS.*

## 2. Emerging Treatment Strategies

*   **BTK Inhibitors:** These investigational drugs show promise in reducing disability progression in progressive MS, independent of relapses or lesions. These inhibitors are particularly promising for progressive forms of MS, where disability progression occurs even without relapses. Tolebrutinib has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for non-relapsing secondary-progressive MS. BTK inhibitors work by reducing the activity of certain immune cells (B cells and microglia) that are believed to contribute to the inflammation and damage in MS. *Neither Tolebrutinib nor Fenebrutinib are yet FDA approved for MS. Discuss potential risks with your doctor if considering participation in trials. If you are interested in learning more about BTK inhibitors or clinical trials, consider asking your doctor questions such as: "Are there any clinical trials for BTK inhibitors that I might be eligible for? What are the potential benefits and risks of these drugs? What are the side effects to be aware of?"*
*   **Remyelination and Repair Strategies:** Remyelination and repair strategies represent a very promising but still early-stage area of MS research. Remyelination is crucial because it aims to repair the damage to the myelin sheath, which protects nerve fibers. Restoring myelin could potentially improve nerve function and slow or even reverse disability progression in MS. If you are interested in learning more about remyelination therapies or clinical trials, consider asking your doctor questions such as: "Are there any clinical trials for remyelination therapies that I might be eligible for? What are the potential benefits and risks of these therapies? What are the side effects to be aware of?"*
*   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** CAR T-cell therapy for MS is still considered highly experimental and is associated with potential serious side effects. Further clinical trials are necessary to rigorously assess the effectiveness and safety of CAR T-cell therapy, particularly for progressive forms of MS, and to understand which patients might benefit most from this highly experimental approach. *If you are interested in learning more about CAR T-cell therapy or clinical trials, consider asking your doctor questions such as: "Are there any clinical trials for CAR T-cell therapy that I might be eligible for? What are the potential benefits and risks of this therapy? What are the side effects to be aware of?"*

## 3. Understanding Disease Mechanisms

*   **Macrophages and Remyelination:** Studies have found that macrophages in people with MS have metabolic anomalies that may hinder remyelination, reducing their capacity to clear myelin debris.
*   **Early Disease Insights:** A sponge-like implant in mice is providing a look at how primary progressive MS attacks the central nervous system early on, leading to potential new treatments. Note: Findings in mice may not directly translate to humans.

## 4. Impact of Lifestyle and Comorbidities

*   **Overall Health and Brain Health:** High blood pressure and cholesterol are associated with decreased grey matter volume in the brain, highlighting the importance of overall health management. *Track your blood pressure and cholesterol levels regularly and discuss management strategies with your doctor.*
*   **Fatigue and Mood:** A reduction in depression symptoms can lead to a reduction in the impact of fatigue. *If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, seek professional help.*
*   **Infections and MS Risk:** An increased risk of MS in people hospitalized for COVID-19 and Epstein-Barr Virus-positive infectious mononucleosis. It is important to note that while studies show an increased risk, the absolute risk of developing MS after these infections is still low.
*   **Diet and MS:** Eating fish is tied to a more favorable MS course, likely due to omega-3 fatty acids, which are believed to reduce inflammation. Oily fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel are good sources of omega-3s. *Aim to include oily fish in your diet a few times per week.*

## 5. Considerations for Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs)

*Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs) are medications used to alter the course of MS.*
*   **Stopping DMTs:** Younger age is associated with an increased risk of MS activity following DMT discontinuation.
*   **De-escalation of Treatment:** For individuals aged 55 years or older who have shown no evidence of disease activity for at least 5 years, "prudent de-escalation" of treatment may be considered. *Discuss this option with your neurologist to weigh the potential benefits and risks.*
*   **Ocrelizumab During Pregnancy:** In utero exposure to ocrelizumab does not appear to increase the risk of complications for the pregnancy or the infant.

## 6. Blood Work and Diagnostic Testing

*   **Blood Tests:** Blood tests help rule out other conditions.
*   **Spinal Tap:** A spinal tap (lumbar puncture) provides valuable information that can support the diagnosis by looking for signs of inflammation.
*   **MRI:** MRI scans are essential to check for lesions or plaques.

## 7. Support and Resources

*   **Support Groups:** Healthcare providers, national MS organizations (National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Multiple Sclerosis Foundation), and online platforms can help find support groups. Support groups can range from general MS groups to those focused on specific demographics or specific challenges.
*   **Online Forums:** Online forums like Multiple Sclerosis News Today provide platforms to connect with others, share experiences, and ask questions.
*   **MS Knowledge Network (Canada):** MS Navigators provide customized information on symptoms, treatments, local support, and MS research.

## Important Considerations for Patients

*   **Personalized Approach to Fatigue:** An individualized approach to managing and treating fatigue is crucial.
*   **Early Treatment:** Starting treatment as early as possible can improve long-term outcomes.
*   **Consultation with Professionals:** Information should be obtained from reputable sources, and healthcare professionals should be consulted for medical advice.
