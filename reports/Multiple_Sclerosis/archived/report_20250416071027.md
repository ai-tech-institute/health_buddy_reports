            # Recent Advances in Multiple Sclerosis: What You Need to Know (Updated November 2024)

This summary highlights key updates in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) research and management, focusing on practical information for patients and their loved ones. Please remember to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.

## 1. Earlier and More Accurate Diagnosis

*   **McDonald Criteria Update (Projected for the Second Half of 2025):** Refinements to the McDonald diagnostic criteria are anticipated, incorporating imaging biomarkers like the central vein sign (a feature seen on MRI scans that is more common in MS lesions) and paramagnetic rim lesions (indicate chronic active inflammation around MS lesions), and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker like kappa free light chains (elevated levels in cerebrospinal fluid can support MS diagnosis). These biomarkers improve diagnostic accuracy. Earlier diagnosis can lead to earlier treatment, potentially slowing disease progression. Once the updated McDonald Criteria are released (projected for the second half of 2025), information will be available from reputable sources like the National MS Society and your neurologist. Discuss with your neurologist how these updated criteria might affect your diagnosis or monitoring.
*   **Prodromal Phase Research:** Researchers are working to identify blood markers (specific proteins or other substances in the blood) that could detect MS in its earliest stages (the prodromal phase refers to the period *before* the typical symptoms of MS become apparent. This is a period where subtle biological changes might be occurring, but are not yet causing clinically evident MS). Identifying this phase could, in the future, allow for earlier intervention strategies or personalized risk assessments. This is research and not a diagnostic tool.

## 2. Emerging Treatments and Considerations

*   **Tolebrutinib (Under FDA Priority Review - Not Yet Approved):** Tolebrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for non-relapsing secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS), a form of MS where disability progresses without relapses. Phase 3 trial results *demonstrated* a statistically significant delay in disability progression in nrSPMS. The FDA target action date is September 28, 2025, and a decision is expected in the EU in Q1 2026. Common side effects reported in trials included headache, nausea, and increased liver enzymes (these side effects were generally mild to moderate in trials and manageable. Liver enzyme increases require regular blood monitoring). If you have nrSPMS and are interested in learning more about Tolebrutinib, discuss it with your neurologist, especially after the FDA decision date of September 28, 2025.
*   **BTK Inhibitors (Phase II Trial Results):** Two Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors showed encouraging Phase II results at the 2025 ACTRIMS meeting. BTK inhibitors work by targeting specific immune cells (B cells) and immune cells in the brain (microglia) that are thought to contribute to MS damage. They aim to reduce inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. Phase II trials showed a significant reduction in the rate of disability progression and significantly fewer new brain lesions compared to placebo. Details were presented at ACTRIMS 2025 and further information can be sought from neurologists or conference materials.
*   **CAR T-cell Therapy (Early Research):** CAR T-cell therapy, used to treat some cancers, is in *very early (Phase I)* research for progressive MS. CAR T-cell therapy aims to "reprogram" some of your immune cells to stop attacking myelin, the protective covering of nerve fibers that is damaged in MS. It's like retraining the immune system to no longer target the body's own tissues. This *highly experimental* therapy is currently only being investigated in Phase I clinical trials, which primarily assess safety. It is *not* a currently available treatment for MS outside of these research trials, and significant further research is needed.
*   **Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) Considerations:** Studies suggest potential risks associated with discontinuing DMT, even after long periods of stability. Some individuals who have been stable on DMT for many years might consider discussing DMT discontinuation with their neurologist, for example, due to concerns about long-term side effects or the burden of treatment. However, it's crucial to *always discuss any decision to discontinue DMT with your neurologist*, even after periods of stability, to understand the potential risks and benefits in your individual case. Discontinuation can lead to a recurrence of inflammatory disease activity, particularly in younger individuals. Disease-modifying treatment can help reduce the risk of disability worsening in people with MS who have experienced rapid worsening of their disability.

## 3. Understanding Your MS Reports

*   **MRI:** Functional MRI (fMRI) can help assess brain activity and identify areas affected by MS, which can be useful in understanding cognitive impairment and monitoring disease progression. Paramagnetic Rim Lesions (PRLs), which indicate chronic active inflammation around MS lesions, can be identified via MRI (see McDonald Criteria Update in Section 1).

## 4. Managing Symptoms and Enhancing Quality of Life

*   **Fatigue and Mood:** Addressing depressive symptoms can significantly reduce fatigue's impact. Communicate openly with your doctor about depression.
*   **Lifestyle Modifications:** It's important to remember that lifestyle modifications are most effective when personalized. What works well for one person with MS might not be suitable for another. Work with your healthcare team to develop a plan that fits your individual needs and preferences.
    *   **Diet:** Focus on lean protein (like chicken breast, fish, beans, and lentils), whole grains (like brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread), and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Reducing processed foods, which are often high in sodium, unhealthy fats, and additives, and limiting overall salt intake can help manage inflammation and support overall health in MS. Consider consulting a registered dietitian or nutritionist, especially one with experience in neurological conditions, for personalized dietary advice tailored to MS.
    *   **Vitamin D:** Essential for immune health; discuss supplementation with your doctor.
    *   **Exercise:** Regular physical activity is beneficial. Examples of beneficial exercises include yoga, Pilates, cycling, and swimming. Chair-based exercises or water therapy might be suitable for those with mobility limitations. Even short periods of activity are beneficial. Emphasize the importance of consulting with a physical therapist or rehabilitation specialist experienced in MS to develop a safe and effective exercise plan tailored to individual abilities and limitations.
    *   **Sleep:** Address sleep issues to improve cognitive function.
    *   **Stress Management:** Use mindfulness, deep breathing, or yoga.
    *   **Social Connections:** Maintain relationships for mental and emotional well-being.
*   **Customizing Your Environment:** Adapt your home and office for efficiency and safety.
*   **MS Awareness Week:** MS Awareness Week 2025 (April 28 - May 4) focuses on MS conversations using #MSConversations.

## 5. MS and Other Health Factors

*   **COVID-19:** A Swedish study *suggests* that people hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment *were found to have a higher risk* of later developing MS, approximately 2.5 times higher than the comparison group (compared to a matched group from the general population). While the study suggests a higher relative risk, it's important to remember that the overall risk of developing MS remains low. This research highlights a potential association that warrants further investigation, but it does not mean that everyone who has had COVID-19 will develop MS. It's important to note that this study suggests an association and does not prove that COVID-19 *causes* MS. More research is needed to understand the relationship.
*   **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV):** EBV-positive infectious mononucleosis increases the risk for MS.
*   **Comorbidities:** Black MS patients are more likely to have high blood pressure at diagnosis.
*   **Colon Cancer Screening:** Standard colon cancer screening guidelines apply to people with MS. Discuss with your doctor when you should begin screening (typically starting at age 45 or 50, or earlier if you have risk factors) and which screening methods are appropriate for you (e.g., colonoscopy, stool-based tests). Emphasize the importance of general health and preventative care for people with MS, including recommended screenings.

## 6. The Future of MS Research

*   **Myelin Repair:** Research is focused on regenerating myelin.
*   **Early Detection:** Researchers are working to identify blood biomarkers for early detection.
*   **Immune Cell Research:** Scientists are exploring how immune cells drive inflammation.
*   **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is being explored as a potential MS treatment because it may help reduce inflammation and promote myelin repair. The vagus nerve plays a role in regulating the immune system, and stimulating it might help to dampen down the autoimmune attacks in MS and encourage the repair of damaged myelin.

## 7. The Importance of Support

*   MSAA's 2025 MS Awareness Month campaign ("Empowered from the Start with MSAA") emphasizes education and support for the newly diagnosed.
*   Organizations like the National MS Society, MS International Federation (MSIF), and MSAA offer support programs, online communities, and resources. (Consider adding contact information or website links for these organizations).
