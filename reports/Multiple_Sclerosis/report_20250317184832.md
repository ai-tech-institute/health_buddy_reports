            # Latest Advances in Multiple Sclerosis: What Patients and Families Need to Know

This summary highlights recent breakthroughs, emerging trends, and practical solutions in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) research, with a focus on empowering patients and their loved ones. We emphasize actionable information to help you understand your condition, treatment options, and available support.

## 1. Advances in Diagnosis

*   **Updated McDonald Criteria:** The McDonald Criteria are being updated to improve early and accurate diagnosis, which is crucial for timely treatment and better patient outcomes. The updated McDonald criteria (expected in 2025) will use more biological markers (like specific molecules in the blood or spinal fluid) and advanced imaging techniques to diagnose MS by providing more objective evidence of the disease process in the brain and spinal cord. These include features seen on MRI scans like the "central vein sign" (a vein in the center of MS lesions) and "paramagnetic rim lesions" (rings of inflammation around lesions), which can help distinguish MS lesions from other conditions. Information will be available on the National MS Society website and in medical journals. It's important to note that the McDonald Criteria are primarily used by clinicians for diagnosis. However, understanding that diagnostic methods are becoming more precise can be reassuring for patients and families navigating the diagnostic process.

*   **Blood-based Biomarkers (NfL and GFAP):** Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a marker of nerve cell damage, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) reflects the activity of astrocytes, a type of brain cell involved in inflammation in MS. Elevated levels of these in blood can indicate disease activity and progression. Tracking these biomarkers can help monitor the disease's course. Patients can ask their neurologist if measuring NfL and GFAP levels is relevant to their individual MS management plan. These tests are becoming more accessible and can provide additional information about disease activity.

## 2. Emerging Treatments and Therapies

*   **Tolebrutinib:** Tolebrutinib is an investigational oral medication known as a BTK inhibitor, which targets immune cells involved in MS. It has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for non-relapsing secondary-progressive MS (nrSPMS). This designation is given to drugs showing significant promise in early trials. It is currently in clinical trials (Phase 3) and is not yet approved by the FDA for general use. The Phase 3 trials are evaluating if Tolebrutinib can slow disability progression in nrSPMS. BTK inhibitors work by reducing the activity of certain immune cells that contribute to inflammation and damage in MS. In clinical trials, common side effects of Tolebrutinib have included headache and nausea. Patients should discuss the potential side effects with their doctor to understand if this treatment might be suitable for them.

*   **Myelin Repair Research:** A new research project focuses on helping the brain repair itself by activating its own healing processes, specifically regenerating myelin. Researchers are exploring how to boost the activity of myelin-producing cells (oligodendrocytes) to encourage new myelin growth. A myelin repair trial (Phase 2 trial, e.g., investigating a small molecule that aims to reduce inflammation and promote myelin regeneration) has completed recruitment, with results expected in late 2025. While myelin repair is a very promising area of research, it is important to remember that clinical trials are research studies, and *there is no guarantee of success*. Results are expected in late 2025, and further research and regulatory approvals would be needed before any new myelin repair therapies become widely available.

*   **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is being explored as a *potential* future therapy for MS, currently in *preclinical research*. Studies in mice have shown promising results: VNS increases myelin-producing cells, improves myelin damage, and partly restores motor function.

*   **Cladribine (Mavenclad):** Cladribine (Mavenclad), approved in the UK by the NHS, in Europe, the United States, and other regions, is a tablet requiring just 20 days of treatment spread over four years, provides a convenient alternative to existing therapies and is being rolled out to patients with relapsing forms of MS and evidence of active disease, such as relapses or new MRI lesions. While convenient, cladribine carries potential side effects, including lymphopenia (low white blood cell count), increased risk of infections, and a potential long-term risk of cancer. Patients require careful monitoring before, during, and after treatment. Discuss the risks and benefits with your neurologist.

*   **CAR T-cell Therapies:** CAR T-cell therapies are showing promise in some autoimmune diseases, and there is *early* interest in exploring them for MS. CAR T-cell therapies are a type of immunotherapy that involves modifying a patient's own immune cells to target and destroy disease-causing cells. While showing promise in other autoimmune conditions, its application in MS is very early stage. Research is in the very early stages, and strategic trial designs are crucial to determine if they can be effective and safe for MS. *It is important to understand that this is a very experimental approach in MS at this time.*

## 3. Understanding Disease Progression and Management

*   **New Framework for Describing MS:** The current way of describing MS types (relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive) is being reconsidered because it may not fully capture the continuous and evolving nature of the disease. A new framework based on underlying biological processes aims to provide a more accurate and personalized understanding of MS progression, which *could* potentially lead to more tailored treatment strategies in the future.

*   **Impact of Early Treatment:** Research suggests that early treatment with disease-modifying therapies can prevent or delay the onset of MS in high-risk groups with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS).

*   **Discontinuing DMTs:** This research highlights that discontinuing DMTs, even in patients with previously stable disease and regardless of age, is associated with an increased risk of disability progression. This is an important consideration when making decisions about continuing or stopping DMTs, and these decisions should be made in close consultation with a neurologist, carefully weighing the risks and benefits for each individual patient.

*   **Pregnancy and MS:** A new study is investigating how pregnancy improves MS symptoms, using MRI scans and blood analysis to understand the underlying mechanisms.

*   **Comorbidities:** People hospitalized with COVID-19 have a slightly increased risk of developing MS later. While the overall risk is still low, this finding suggests a potential link between severe viral infections and MS development, which is an area of ongoing research. Women with MS are at higher risk for weight gain than men.

*   **The MSDA Test:** The Octave Multiple Sclerosis Disease Activity (MSDA) Test is a *commercially available* blood test that enables patients to measure disease activity through a simple blood test based on the levels of 18 proteins in the blood. The MSDA test provides a numeric "disease activity score" and scores for different biological pathways involved in MS. These scores are intended to provide doctors with additional information to help monitor disease activity over time and potentially guide treatment decisions, such as assessing the effectiveness of current therapy or identifying patients who might benefit from a change in treatment strategy. While the MSDA test can provide additional data points, it is important to understand that it is not a diagnostic test for MS itself and its role in routine MS management and treatment decisions is still evolving within the medical community. Its results should always be interpreted in the context of a comprehensive neurological assessment and in consultation with your neurologist.

## 4. Practical Support and Lifestyle Considerations

*   **MS Awareness Month:** MSAA's MS Awareness Month campaign focuses on education, empowerment, and support for newly diagnosed individuals.

*   **Seasonal Considerations:** MS symptoms can worsen during extreme weather. For example, patients may find cooling vests and staying in air-conditioned environments helpful in summer heat, and dressing in layers and using warming blankets can alleviate stiffness in colder months.

*   **Importance of Exercise:** Regular exercise can improve cardiovascular fitness, strength, bladder and bowel function, and mood. Exercise recommendations should be personalized based on individual abilities and limitations. Examples include walking, swimming, adapted yoga, chair exercises, and physiotherapy programs designed for people with MS.

*   **Diet:** Some dietary approaches, such as the Mediterranean diet and diets focusing on reduced saturated fat intake, are often discussed in MS management. While research is ongoing, a generally healthy diet like the Mediterranean style, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, and low in saturated and processed fats, is often recommended. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods and ensure adequate vitamin D intake. Discuss specific dietary needs with a registered dietitian or healthcare provider.

*   **Addressing Sleep Issues:** MS can cause sleep problems. If you experience sleep problems, it's crucial to discuss them with your doctor. Treatment options may include addressing underlying MS symptoms, medications, sleep hygiene strategies, or referral to a sleep specialist.

*   **Home Environment:** Customizing the home environment for maximum efficiency and minimum risk can make life easier. Simple home modifications can significantly improve daily living. Examples include installing grab bars in bathrooms, using assistive devices for dressing and cooking, ensuring good lighting and clear pathways to prevent falls, and using mobility aids as needed.

*   **Support Resources:** Resources and communities are available to provide support, information, and friendship. Utilize resources such as the National MS Society, the MSAA, and other MS organizations for information, support groups (both online and in-person), educational programs, and financial assistance programs. Connecting with online MS communities can also provide valuable peer support and shared experiences.

## 5. Interpreting Reports and Blood Work

Understanding your blood work is a key part of managing your MS. Always discuss the results of any blood work with your doctor to understand what they mean for your individual case.

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** A Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a routine blood test that helps rule out other conditions that can mimic MS symptoms, such as infections or anemia. It checks for overall blood health.

*   **Thyroid Hormone Levels:** Thyroid problems can sometimes cause symptoms similar to MS, so thyroid hormone tests are often done to exclude thyroid disease as a cause of symptoms.

*   **NMO-IgG Blood Test:** The NMO-IgG blood test helps distinguish MS from Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), also known as Devic's disease, another autoimmune disease affecting the optic nerves and spinal cord. A positive NMO-IgG test suggests NMO rather than MS.

*   **Octave MSDA Test:** Specialized blood tests like the Octave MSDA Test (described in section 3) may also be used to measure and track disease activity over time.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements and practical considerations in MS, focusing on information that is both new and valuable for patients and their families.
