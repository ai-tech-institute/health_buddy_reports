# Recent Advances in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - April 2025

This summary highlights recent developments in MS diagnosis, treatment, and symptom management, focusing on actionable information that can benefit patients and their families.

## MS Diagnosis: Earlier and More Accurate

**Why is earlier diagnosis beneficial?** Earlier diagnosis allows for quicker initiation of disease-modifying therapies, which can help slow the progression of MS and manage symptoms more effectively.

### Revised McDonald Criteria (2024): A Biomarker-Driven Approach

The diagnostic criteria for MS have been updated to allow for earlier and more accurate diagnoses.

*   **Biomarkers:** The new criteria emphasize a "biomarker-driven" approach, using measurable substances in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and advanced imaging to detect the disease. These biomarkers might include substances like **neurofilament light chain (NfL)**, which is being studied in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
*   **MRI Evidence:** The 2024 McDonald Criteria allows diagnosis based solely on MRI evidence if specific markers are met, showing new MS activity over time **(Dissemination In Time - DIT)** and showing MS lesions in different areas of the brain and/or spinal cord **(Dissemination In Space - DIS)**.
*   **Central Vein Sign (CVS):** The presence of six or more CVS-positive lesions on MRI can strengthen the diagnosis of MS, especially when combined with other criteria. The central vein sign helps differentiate MS lesions from those caused by other conditions. The central vein sign is a promising imaging marker, but it's important to note that **it is not yet universally adopted as a definitive diagnostic criterion and is used as supportive evidence alongside other clinical and MRI findings**.
*   **Optic Neuritis:** When optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve) is present, antibody tests are crucial to **distinguish between MS and other similar conditions that can also cause optic neuritis**. Specifically, aquaporin-4 antibody tests are used to rule out **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)**, and MOG antibody tests help rule out **Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody-Associated Disease (MOGAD)**. Accurate differentiation is crucial because the treatment approaches for MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD can differ significantly.
*   **Early Detection Research:** Research focuses on identifying early features and biomarkers of MS to allow for earlier interventions and potentially better long-term outcomes for individuals at risk of MS.

**Key Takeaway:** These diagnostic advancements aim to ensure people with MS are diagnosed earlier and more accurately, leading to timely and appropriate care.

## MS Treatments: New Approaches and Potential Therapies

### Tolebrutinib: Targeting Progressive MS

Tolebrutinib, an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has received 'Breakthrough Therapy' designation from the FDA for **non-relapsing secondary-progressive MS (nrSPMS)**. **nrSPMS is a form of progressive MS where the disease worsens over time without distinct relapses.** BTK inhibitors work by reducing the activity of certain immune cells that are believed to contribute to the inflammation and progression of MS. Tolebrutinib is currently in **Phase 3 clinical trials** to assess its safety and effectiveness and is not yet FDA approved. The 'Breakthrough Therapy' designation is meant to speed up the development and review process due to its potential benefit. If approved, tolebrutinib could offer a new treatment option specifically for non-relapsing secondary-progressive MS, a form of MS where treatment options are currently limited. Like other BTK inhibitors, potential side effects such as infections are being carefully monitored in clinical trials.

### BTK Inhibitors: A Promising Treatment Target

BTK inhibitors, like tolebrutinib and fenebrutinib, are designed to target **B cells and myeloid cells in the brain and immune system, which are thought to play a role in the inflammation and progression of MS.** BTK inhibitors work by reducing the activity of certain immune cells that are believed to contribute to the inflammation and progression of MS. Fenebrutinib is currently in Phase 3 trials. Early results are promising, showing high rates of patients remaining relapse-free. **Top-line results from the Phase 3 trials are anticipated to be available by the end of 2025, as the full data analysis and publication process will take longer.**

### Cell Therapy: An Experimental and Emerging Field

Cell therapies, including CAR T-cell therapy, are in the **very early stages of clinical trials** for MS and are **not yet established or approved treatments**. These are **highly experimental approaches** being investigated as a *potential* future treatment, particularly for progressive forms of MS. **It's crucial to understand that these therapies are not currently available outside of clinical trials and involve significant risks and uncertainties.** It is important for patients to understand that cell therapies for MS are currently a subject of research and are not yet established treatments available for routine clinical use. Patients should be cautious of any claims suggesting otherwise.

### Ublituximab (Briumvi®): Expanding Treatment Options

Ublituximab (Briumvi®) is already approved in some regions but is **being considered for broader access in Australia**. Specifically, it is under review for inclusion on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) in Australia in May 2025 for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). **Inclusion on the PBS would make Briumvi® more affordable and accessible to eligible patients in Australia.** Briumvi® targets a different **epitope (specific part)** of the CD20 protein on B cells compared to other anti-CD20 therapies, which may offer potentially faster infusion times. Briumvi® targets CD20, a protein on B cells, which are a type of immune cell involved in the inflammation seen in MS. Faster infusion times can be more convenient and comfortable for patients, reducing the time spent in treatment centers.

### Remyelination Research: Helping the Brain Heal Itself

Remyelination research is a very promising area, but therapies based on these findings are **still in the laboratory and early stages of development**. **No remyelination therapies are currently available to patients.** Dr. Fletcher's team's work is focused on understanding and activating the brain's natural repair mechanisms, which is a crucial step towards developing future treatments. If successful, remyelination therapies could potentially restore lost neurological function in people with MS by repairing the damage to the myelin sheath.

## MS Symptoms & Management: Improving Quality of Life

### Fatigue: Addressing Depression

A study found that reducing depression symptoms can also lessen the impact of fatigue in people with MS. If you experience fatigue and symptoms of depression, discuss treatment options with your doctor. **Effective management of depression can involve therapy (such as cognitive behavioral therapy or counseling) and/or medication (antidepressants).** Choosing the right approach depends on individual needs and preferences, and discussing these options with your doctor is essential. Treating depression effectively, whether through therapy or medication, has been shown to be an important strategy in managing MS-related fatigue, and these are proven approaches to improve mood and energy levels.

### Brain Stimulation (rTMS): Investigational Symptom Relief

A **clinical trial** is underway using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to target brain cells with electromagnetic waves, potentially relieving MS symptoms like fatigue and improving mood. rTMS uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain, aiming to modulate brain activity and potentially alleviate symptoms. **rTMS is not yet a standard or widely available treatment for MS symptoms and is currently being investigated in research settings.**

### Overall Health: A Key Factor

Maintaining good overall health is important for managing MS. This includes managing blood pressure and cholesterol through diet and medication if needed, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking.

## Important Safety Information: Anaphylaxis Warning

### Glatiramer Acetate (Copaxone and Glatopa):

The FDA issued a warning about the risk of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) with the use of glatiramer acetate. Symptoms of anaphylaxis can include hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, wheezing, dizziness, and a sudden drop in blood pressure. If you experience any of these symptoms after glatiramer acetate injection, seek immediate medical attention.

## Understanding MS Reports and Blood Work: Key Information

**Why is understanding MRI reports helpful?** Understanding the basics of MRI reports can help patients become more informed participants in discussions about their MS and treatment plans with their healthcare providers.

### MRI Reports: Interpreting the Results

It is best to review an MRI report with your physician.

*   **T1 Sequences:** Show the brain and spinal cord's structure in detail. They can highlight areas called "**black holes**" or "**dark spots**" (also known as "hypointense lesions"). These represent areas where brain tissue has **shrunk or been lost due to previous MS damage (atrophy)**.
*   **T2 Sequences:** Highlight areas of **demyelination**, which is damage to the protective covering around nerve fibers. MS lesions appear as **bright white spots** (also called "hyperintense lesions") on these sequences. T2 sequences help show the **overall amount of MS lesions** in the brain and spinal cord.
*   **Contrast-Enhanced Sequences:** Use a special dye given through a vein to show **new or active areas of MS**. **'Enhancing lesions'** on contrast-enhanced T1 sequences indicate areas of active inflammation and recent disease activity.

### Blood Tests and Spinal Fluid Analysis: Ruling Out Other Conditions

Blood tests cannot diagnose MS but are essential to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), obtained through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), can sometimes provide supportive evidence for MS. **Elevated levels of IgG antibodies or proteins called oligoclonal bands in CSF can be seen in people with MS, but these findings are not specific to MS and can be present in other conditions.** Therefore, while the presence of oligoclonal bands can support an MS diagnosis, **it is not definitive on its own and needs to be interpreted alongside clinical findings and MRI results**. Importantly, **a normal CSF result does not rule out MS**, as about 5% to 10% of people with MS may not have any CSF abnormalities.

## Future Directions

Ongoing research in MS is exploring personalized medicine approaches, advanced imaging techniques to better understand disease progression, and preventative strategies for those at high risk.
