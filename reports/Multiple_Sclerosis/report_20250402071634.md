# Latest on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - 2025: What Matters to You

This summary highlights key updates in MS research, focusing on practical implications and less commonly known facts to empower you and your family.

## Diagnosis and Early Detection

*   **Revised McDonald Criteria (2025):** The McDonald criteria for diagnosing MS have been updated to allow for earlier and more accurate diagnoses. The 2025 revisions place greater emphasis on MRI findings (abnormalities seen on brain scans) and specific biomarkers (measurable substances in the body that can indicate a disease process), potentially allowing diagnosis with fewer clinical attacks. For example, the criteria put more weight on advanced imaging markers like the central vein sign and paramagnetic rim lesions detected via MRI, and laboratory measures like kappa free light chains in spinal fluid. Earlier diagnosis can lead to earlier treatment, potentially slowing disease progression and improving long-term outcomes. Diagnosing MS remains a complex process that requires expert evaluation by a neurologist. These updated criteria are tools to aid in this process.
*   **Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS):** The updated criteria refine the understanding of Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS). RIS, characterized by MS-like lesions on MRI in people *without* MS symptoms, is now considered to indicate a higher risk of developing clinical MS. The updated criteria help identify individuals with RIS who are at higher risk of progressing to clinically definite MS, allowing for closer monitoring and potential early intervention discussions with their healthcare provider. The management of RIS is still evolving, and there is no current consensus on when or if to start treatment for individuals with RIS. Ongoing research aims to better define the best approach for those with RIS. While RIS indicates an increased *risk* of developing clinical MS, not everyone with RIS will go on to develop MS.

## New and Emerging Treatments

For each drug, we aim to provide: target MS type, how it works, delivery method, trial status, benefits, side effects, and availability.

*   **Tolebrutinib:** This oral BTK inhibitor is being developed for *non-relapsing* secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS). It works by targeting B cells and microglia in the brain to reduce inflammation. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation (speeds up review) for nrSPMS. Phase III PERSEUS study for *primary* progressive MS (PPMS) results are expected in the first half of this year. *It is important to understand that Breakthrough Therapy Designation accelerates the review process by the FDA, but it does not guarantee that the drug will ultimately be approved.* Common side effects observed in trials have included headache and fatigue. Consult your neurologist to see if participating in the PERSEUS study or if tolebrutinib becomes an approved option for nrSPMS is right for you.*
*   **Fenebrutinib:** Also a BTK inhibitor, this drug is being tested for both relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Phase II results announced in September 2024 showed 96% of patients treated with fenebrutinib were free of MS relapses after one year in the Phase II trial. Phase 3 clinical trial results are expected by the end of 2025. Common side effects are being monitored in ongoing trials. Approval and availability are dependent on successful Phase 3 trial outcomes and regulatory review.
*   **BTK Inhibitors: A New Approach:** BTK inhibitors are a *class* of drugs being investigated for MS. Tolebrutinib and fenebrutinib are examples. They target B cells and microglia, immune cells involved in MS inflammation.
*   **PIPE-307:** This drug is in a Phase 2 trial for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). It aims to help rebuild the protective coating around nerves (myelin sheath) by encouraging the development of stem cells called oligodendrocytes. This is a very early-stage trial, and it is important to understand that research is still in the initial phases to determine if PIPE-307 is safe and effective for treating MS.
*   **Cell Therapies (CAR-T, g-NK, Treg):** Several cell therapies are in *very early-stage* clinical trials (likely Phase 1 or 2) for progressive forms of MS, such as primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS), where treatment options are more limited. *These are highly experimental therapies, and while showing early promise, their effectiveness and long-term safety are still being rigorously investigated. The risks and benefits are not yet fully understood.* Participation in these trials often has strict eligibility criteria. Discuss with your neurologist if you are interested in learning more about these options and potential clinical trials.
    *   **CAR-T cell therapy:** Involves modifying a patient's own T cells to target and destroy specific cells involved in MS. Examples include eque-cel, azer-cel, and IMPT-514.
    *   **g-NK cell therapy:** g-NK cells are natural killer cells that are enhanced to fight disease. An example is IDP-023.
    *   **Treg therapy:** Treg cells are regulatory T cells that help to dampen down the immune system. An example is ABA-101.
*   **Ocrevus (ocrelizumab):** This drug is already FDA-approved for RRMS and PPMS. Recent research suggests Ocrevus may help reduce chronic inflammation in certain types of MS lesions (called paramagnetic rim lesions), potentially by reducing iron buildup and promoting myelin repair within these lesions. This research aims to understand how Ocrevus works at a deeper level.
*   **Ublituximab-xiiy (Briumvi):** Approved by the FDA in 2022 for RRMS and active SPMS, Briumvi works by targeting and reducing B cells, a type of immune cell that contributes to inflammation and damage in MS.

## Understanding MS Biology

*   **Microglia Research:** Researchers are investigating ways to switch off overactive microglia (immune cells in the brain) by targeting their energy source. This research into microglia energy sources *could* lead to new drugs that specifically target overactive microglia, potentially offering a new way to slow down or stop MS progression by reducing brain inflammation. However, this research is still in its very early stages, and it may take several years before these findings could potentially lead to new treatments for MS.
*   **Inflammation Outside the Brain:** Research suggests that inflammation outside the brain, caused by infections, smoking, or obesity, could contribute to the progression of MS. This highlights the importance of managing overall health to potentially impact MS progression. Discuss with your doctor strategies to manage infections promptly, quit smoking, and maintain a healthy weight as part of your overall MS management plan.

## Managing Symptoms and Improving Quality of Life

*   **Digital Health Interventions:** Researchers are exploring digital health interventions to manage symptoms like pain, anxiety, and sexual difficulties. Examples include smartphone apps for tracking symptoms and managing medications, wearable sensors to monitor activity levels and sleep, and online platforms offering tailored exercise programs and psychological support.
*   **Non-Pharmacological Symptom Management:** New doctoral training centers are exploring non-drug approaches to manage MS symptoms. These centers are investigating therapies like virtual reality-based rehabilitation for mobility and cognitive issues, dance and movement therapies to combat fatigue and improve balance, and mindfulness and meditation techniques for pain and anxiety management.
*   **The Importance of Overall Health:** A study found that having high blood pressure or high levels of “bad” cholesterol was associated with decreased grey matter volume in the brain. This study reinforces the importance of managing cardiovascular health in MS. Work with your doctor to monitor and manage blood pressure and cholesterol levels as part of a heart-healthy lifestyle, which may also benefit brain health in MS.
*   **Importance of Vaccinations:** Researchers found that inflammation from infections was linked to a loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord, highlighting the importance of early treatment for infections and staying up to date with vaccinations. Discuss your individual vaccination needs and which vaccinations are specifically recommended for you with your healthcare provider, taking into account your MS and any DMTs you are taking. It is also important to discuss with your healthcare provider whether any of your current MS medications (DMTs) might affect the type of vaccines you can safely receive, as live vaccines may be contraindicated for individuals on certain DMTs.

## Interpreting Blood Work

Blood work is an important part of MS care for several reasons:

*   **Ruling Out Other Conditions:** Blood tests are crucial for ruling out other conditions that mimic MS symptoms (such as Lyme disease, lupus, thyroid disease, and vitamin deficiencies) and to identify any other health issues that could be contributing to symptoms.
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** A CBC checks the different types of cells in your blood. It can help detect anemia (low red blood cells, which can cause fatigue), signs of inflammation like vasculitis (high white blood cells), or infections.
*   **Biomarkers:** Researchers are actively working to develop blood tests that can detect specific biomarkers in the blood that are characteristic of MS. These tests, if successful, could provide easier and earlier diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity. However, biomarker tests for MS diagnosis are still under development and not yet routinely used in clinical practice.
*   **Neurofilament Light Chain:** Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein released when nerve cells are damaged. Elevated levels of NfL in the blood have been detected even several years before the onset of typical MS symptoms. NfL is being investigated as a potential marker to identify individuals at higher risk of developing MS and to track disease activity and treatment response. However, NfL testing is not yet a standard diagnostic tool in clinical practice.
*   **Oligoclonal bands:** Oligoclonal bands are proteins called antibodies that are often found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of people with MS. Obtaining the CSF requires a lumbar puncture or spinal tap. Their presence indicates that there is an immune response happening within the brain and spinal cord, supporting the diagnosis of MS. While helpful, oligoclonal bands are not specific to MS and can be seen in other conditions.

## MS Support and Advocacy

*   **World MS Day (2024-2025):** The global World MS Day campaign focuses on advocating for early and accurate diagnosis for everyone living with MS. [https://worldmsday.org/](https://worldmsday.org/) Find ways to get involved via online campaigns or local events.
*   **Access to Treatments:** There are new recommendations to support advocacy for improved access to MS treatments globally. Contact your local MS society, write to policymakers, or participate in advocacy campaigns.
*   **MS Society Stop MS Appeal:** 2025 marks the final year of the MS Society's Stop MS Appeal, aiming to halt MS progression for everyone. [https://mssociety.ca/](https://mssociety.ca/)

## Important Considerations

*   **Pregnancy and MS Treatments:** A large study found that most MS treatments do not increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, or major congenital anomalies. This study provides reassuring evidence about the safety of many MS treatments during pregnancy. Women with MS who are planning pregnancy should have detailed discussions with their neurologist and obstetrician to make informed decisions about continuing, switching, or stopping MS treatments based on their individual situation and the specific medication.
*   **COVID-19 and MS Risk:** A study suggests that people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 may have a slightly increased risk of developing MS later. However, it is important to note that the overall risk remains low, and most people who have had COVID-19 will not develop MS. This research highlights the potential long-term neurological effects of severe viral infections and the need for ongoing monitoring.
*   **Discontinuation of DMTs:** Discontinuing disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) without consulting a doctor can lead to a relapse or worsening of MS symptoms in some individuals. Always discuss any plans to stop or change your MS treatment with your neurologist.
*   **Anaphylaxis Warning for Copaxone® and Glatopa®:** The FDA has issued a warning about the risk of anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) with Copaxone® and Glatopa® (glatiramer acetate). Be aware of the symptoms of anaphylaxis (e.g., hives, swelling, difficulty breathing) and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms after injection. Discuss any concerns with your prescribing doctor.
