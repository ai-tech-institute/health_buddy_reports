# Latest Research in Multiple Sclerosis: What It Means for You

This summary highlights recent advancements in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) research, focusing on practical information to benefit individuals with MS and their loved ones. We aim to translate complex findings into actionable steps for improved well-being and disease management.

**Disclaimer:** This summary is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. Always consult with your healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment decisions related to Multiple Sclerosis.

## 1. Earlier and More Accurate Diagnosis

*   **The McDonald Criteria: Refining MS Diagnosis:** The established McDonald Criteria, used for MS diagnosis, are being updated. The 2024 McDonald Criteria updates are anticipated to be published and implemented around 2025. These updates integrate biomarkers (measurable indicators) like neurofilament light chain (NfL) in blood and advanced MRI techniques for a potentially earlier and more accurate diagnosis, which is crucial for initiating timely treatment and potentially improving long-term outcomes for individuals with MS.

## 2. Emerging Treatment Strategies

*   **BTK Inhibitors: A Promising Avenue (Still Investigational):** BTK inhibitors are being studied in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for various forms of MS, including progressive MS. Examples include tolebrutinib and evobrutinib. They work by targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase, an enzyme involved in the activation of B cells and microglia, both of which play a role in MS inflammation and neurodegeneration. Phase 2 trials have shown promising results in terms of relapse rate reduction or slowing disability progression. Phase 2 trials are often shorter-term studies, while Phase 3 trials typically last longer to assess long-term efficacy and safety. Common side effects being monitored in BTK inhibitor trials include infections, liver enzyme elevations, and gastrointestinal issues; however, the safety profiles are still being fully characterized. Patients interested in exploring BTK inhibitors should discuss clinical trial participation with their neurologist. Information about ongoing trials can be found at clinicaltrials.gov. These drugs are *not yet approved* for general use outside of clinical trials.
*   **Ublituximab (Briumvi®): Expanding Treatment Options:** Ublituximab (Briumvi®) is *approved* for relapsing-remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS in the US and Europe. Ublituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, similar to ocrelizumab and rituximab, that works by selectively depleting B cells, a type of immune cell believed to play a role in MS. Briumvi® is administered as an intravenous infusion. Common side effects include infusion reactions, infections, and decreased immunoglobulins. In Australia, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) is reviewing ublituximab (Briumvi®) for inclusion on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Australians can discuss access options with their neurologists, including potential compassionate access programs and participating in clinical trials that might be available in Australia for similar drugs or even ublituximab itself if any ongoing trials are accessible, while awaiting the PBS decision.

## 3. Understanding MS Progression and Risk

*   **Comorbidities: Differences Across Populations:** The prevalence of comorbid conditions (other health conditions occurring alongside MS) at MS diagnosis can differ significantly by race and ethnicity. Examples of such comorbidities include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health conditions (depression, anxiety). Recognizing these differences is important for ensuring equitable healthcare, as it may necessitate proactive screening and management of specific comorbidities in certain racial and ethnic groups with MS to improve overall health outcomes.

## 4. The Importance of Lifestyle and Overall Health

*   **Metabolic Syndrome: A Worsening Factor in MS:** Metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, abdominal obesity, and insulin resistance) can worsen MS symptoms. Discuss screening for metabolic syndrome with your doctor. Screening typically involves measuring blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol levels (including HDL and triglycerides), and waist circumference. Consider a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, and limit intake of red meat, processed foods, fried foods, and many commercially baked goods which are often high in unhealthy fats and reduce sugary drinks, candy, and desserts. Consult a registered dietician or nutritionist to discuss dietary changes.

## 5. Practical Advice for Living with MS

*   **MS Awareness Week 2025: April 28 – May 4:** MS Awareness Week 2025 emphasizes MS conversations to educate others and provide support. Consider participating by sharing your story or attending local events. Visit the National MS Society ([https://www.nationalmssociety.org/](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/)) for more information.
*   **Symptom Tracking: Be Aware of Your Body:** Track your symptoms using smartphone apps designed for health tracking or a simple notebook to record your symptoms, triggers, and medication responses.
*   **Reach Out for Help: You Are Not Alone:** Connect with MS specialist neurologists, therapists specializing in chronic illness, MS support groups (through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society ([https://www.nationalmssociety.org/](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/)), the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America, or local MS Society chapters), and online MS communities.

## 6. Understanding Blood Work

*   **Ruling Out Other Conditions:** Blood tests can't confirm MS but are crucial to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as anemia, thyroid disease, Lyme disease, and vasculitis.

## 7. MS Research

*   Worldwide MS research efforts are focused on understanding the brain's natural repair mechanisms and developing therapies to activate these processes, such as promoting remyelination and neuroprotection. Researchers are exploring various strategies, including identifying drugs that can enhance the activity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to promote remyelination, and investigating neuroprotective agents to protect nerve cells from damage.
