# Understanding the Latest in Multiple Sclerosis: A Guide for Patients and Families (April 2025)

This summary highlights recent developments in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) research and care, focusing on aspects that empower patients and their families to make informed decisions in partnership with their healthcare providers.

## Diagnostics and Monitoring: Getting a Clearer Picture

*   **Evolving Diagnostic Criteria (McDonald Criteria):** Proposed updates to the McDonald criteria (under review, potentially published in 2025) may refine MS diagnosis by placing greater emphasis on *biomarkers*. The *currently published and widely used criteria are from 2017*. Key biomarkers include:
    *   **Central Vein Sign (CVS) and Paramagnetic Rim Lesions (PRL) on MRI:** These advanced imaging markers provide objective evidence of MS pathology and inflammation in the brain. CVS helps distinguish MS lesions from other conditions. PRL indicates chronic active inflammation.
    *   **Kappa Free Light Chains and Oligoclonal Bands (OCBs) in Cerebrospinal Fluid:** Elevated levels of both indicate antibody production *within* the central nervous system, which points to CNS-specific inflammation. OCBs are a more established and frequently used biomarker.
    *   **Action:** *If you are undergoing diagnostic testing for MS, discuss with your neurologist how these criteria and biomarkers are being used.*

## Treatment Advances: New Options and Hope

*   **BTK Inhibitors: Potential for Progressive and Relapsing MS:** BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) inhibitors are *investigational* drugs showing promise in reducing disability progression in progressive forms of MS and are also being investigated for relapsing forms of MS. These drugs work by targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase, an enzyme important in the function of certain immune cells like B cells and potentially brain-resident immune cells, aiming to reduce both inflammation and potentially protect nerve cells. They are *not yet approved* for MS in most regions (as of late 2024/early 2025).
    *   **Action:** *Discuss with your neurologist if BTK inhibitors might be a relevant emerging therapy for you as they become available.*

*   **Ublituximab (Briumvi): A Newer Option for Relapsing MS:** Ublituximab is an *approved* anti-CD20 therapy for relapsing forms of MS (RMS), including clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary progressive MS (SPMS).
    *   **Dosage/Administration:** Administered via IV infusion. Initial doses are given 2 weeks apart, followed by maintenance infusions every 6 months. Notably, after the initial doses, the infusion time is shorter (approximately 1 hour) compared to ocrelizumab.
    *   **Action:** *If you have relapsing MS, discuss with your neurologist whether ublituximab is a suitable treatment option for you.*

*   **Monitoring Axonal Damage with Neurofilament Blood Tests:** A blood test measuring neurofilament levels can help *support* a neurologist's assessment of disease activity and treatment response. Decreasing neurofilament levels after starting a DMT *may* suggest the treatment is helping protect brain tissue. However, it is *not* a diagnostic test.
    *   **Action:** *Talk to your healthcare team about how blood tests and imaging are used to monitor your disease and treatment response.* Track these levels over time to assess the effectiveness of your treatment plan.

## Lifestyle and Overall Health: Taking Control

*   **Overall Health is Paramount:** Managing overall health (blood pressure, cholesterol, weight) is crucial for managing MS.
    *   **Action:** *Work with your doctor to manage cardiovascular risk factors.* Aim for target ranges for blood pressure (below 130/80 mmHg) and cholesterol (LDL below 100 mg/dL), adjusting lifestyle and medications as needed.

*   **Gut Microbiome:** Research continues to explore how the balance of bacteria in the gut ('gut microbiome') may influence the immune system and inflammation, both of which are central to MS.
    *   **Action:** *Consider incorporating gut-friendly foods, such as fiber-rich vegetables, into your diet.* Aim for at least 25-30 grams of fiber daily.

## Living Well with MS: Key Considerations

*   **Early Symptoms**: Early MS symptoms can include vision problems, muscle weakness, and sensory changes (tingling, numbness). Pain can occur with optic neuritis and trigeminal neuralgia. It's important to remember that early MS symptoms vary significantly from person to person.
    *   **Action:** *If you experience any of these symptoms, see your doctor for an evaluation.*

*   **Discontinuing DMTs:** Younger people were associated with increased risk of MS activity following discontinuation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT). This is because stopping a DMT can lead to a return or increase in MS activity, sometimes rapidly, for some individuals.
    *   **Action:** *Consult with your neurologist before stopping a DMT.* Discuss the potential risks and benefits, and explore alternative treatment strategies if needed.
