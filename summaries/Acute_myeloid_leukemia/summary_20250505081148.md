## AML Insights for Patients and Caregivers (May 2025)

**Disclaimer:** This report provides key information to help you make informed decisions about your AML care. Treatment outcomes and side effects can vary. *Always* discuss options with your doctor. Investigational therapies are being studied and may not be right for everyone. Eligibility for clinical trials depends on specific health factors.

### 1. Know Your Approved AML Treatment Options

Recent advances offer new hope. Here's a breakdown of approved therapies and what to discuss with your doctor:

*   **Revumenib (Sykfos®):** For AML with a *KMT2A* gene rearrangement.
    *   **Action:** If you have a *KMT2A* rearrangement, ask your doctor about Revumenib.
    *   **Monitor:** Watch for differentiation syndrome, heart rhythm changes, and blood count issues.
*   **Iomab-B (I-131 apamistamab):** For patients 55+ needing a stem cell transplant. It uses targeted radiation to prepare the bone marrow for the new stem cells.
    *   **Action:** If you're over 55 and need a transplant, ask about Iomab-B.
    *   **Be Aware:** Myelosuppression, mucositis, and GI problems are possible.
*   **GRAFAPEX (Treosulfan):** Used before stem cell transplants in adults with AML or MDS following intensive conditioning with busulfan and/or cyclophosphamide.
    *   **Action:** Discuss if this regimen is right for you and weigh the risks/benefits.
    *   **Key Side Effects:** Low blood counts, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, and liver issues.
*   ***FLT3* Inhibitors:** Your *FLT3* mutation status determines eligibility. *FLT3* mutation testing is essential.
    *   Midostaurin: For *newly diagnosed* AML with a *FLT3* mutation, used with chemotherapy.
    *   Gilteritinib, Quizartinib, Fedratinib: For *relapsed/refractory* AML with a *FLT3* mutation. Quizartinib is also approved for newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD AML with chemotherapy.
    *   **Action:** Get tested for *FLT3* mutations to see if these drugs are an option.
    *   **Common Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and liver changes. Quizartinib can cause QTc prolongation, and Fedratinib may lead to pancreatitis or neuropathy.
*   ***IDH* Inhibitors:** Target *IDH1/2* mutations. *IDH1/2* testing is essential.
    *   Enasidenib: For *relapsed/refractory* AML with an *IDH2* mutation.
    *   Ivosidenib: For *relapsed/refractory* AML with an *IDH1* mutation and *newly diagnosed* AML with an *IDH1* mutation (with azacitidine or alone for older/unfit patients).
     *   Olutasidenib: *Relapsed/refractory* IDH1-mutated AML.
    *   **Action:** Get tested for *IDH1/2* mutations to check eligibility.
    *   **Side Effects:** Differentiation syndrome, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue are possible.
*   **Venetoclax:** For *newly diagnosed* AML in adults 75+ or those unable to undergo intensive chemotherapy. Used with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine.
    *   **Action:** If you can't tolerate intensive chemo, discuss Venetoclax.
    *   **Watch For:** Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), low blood counts, nausea, and fatigue.

### 2. Clinical Trials: Exploring New Options

Clinical trials can offer access to cutting-edge treatments. Discuss these with your doctor, keeping in mind eligibility criteria:

*   **LYT-200:** Investigational monoclonal antibody for relapsed/refractory AML.
    *   **Action:** Ask your doctor about the LYT-200 trial.
    *   **Possible Side Effects:** Infusion reactions, fatigue, nausea, and immune issues.
*   **Ziftomenib:** Investigational menin inhibitor for relapsed/refractory AML with *NPM1* mutations or *KMT2A* rearrangements.
    *   **Action:** If you have these mutations, explore this clinical trial.
    *   **Monitor For:** Differentiation syndrome, low blood counts, nausea, and elevated liver enzymes.
*   **CAR NK Cell Therapy:** Modified Natural Killer cells target leukemia cells. Shows early promise in Phase 1 trials for relapsed/refractory AML.
    *   **Action:** Consider this innovative approach.
    *   **Side Effects:** Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity are possible.
*   **Tambiciclib (SLS009):** Investigational CDK9 inhibitor for relapsed/refractory AML.
    *   **Action:** Inquire about clinical trial access.
    *   **Side Effects:** Myelosuppression, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea are possible.

### 3. Know Your AML Profile: Key Tests

Testing is vital to personalize your treatment:

*   **Cytogenetic Analysis:** Checks chromosomes for changes to determine AML risk.
*   **Molecular Studies:** Identifies gene mutations (like *FLT3*, *NPM1*, *IDH1/2*) that may qualify you for targeted therapies.
*   **Measurable Residual Disease (MRD):** Detects minimal leukemia remaining after treatment to predict relapse risk.
*   **Prognostic Scores (ELN 2022):** Classify AML into risk groups (favorable, intermediate, adverse) to guide treatment.

**Action:** Discuss how these tests can inform your treatment plan and outlook with your doctor.

### 4. Practical Tips for Patients & Caregivers

*   Immediately report any new or worsening symptoms.
*   **Nutrition:** Eat a balanced diet, limit red/processed meats, and ensure food safety.
*   Stay hydrated and maintain good hygiene. Report fever right away.
*   Get support from friends, family, support groups, and professionals.
*   Think about treatment at a specialized AML center.
*   Talk to your team about vaccinations (flu, pneumonia, COVID-19).
*   Discuss the impact of treatment on fertility and explore preservation options.
*   Address financial concerns and explore assistance programs like the Lazarex Cancer Foundation and CancerCare.
