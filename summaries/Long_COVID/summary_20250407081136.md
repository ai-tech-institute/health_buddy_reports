# Long COVID: Essential Updates for Patient Care (April 7, 2025)

**Disclaimer:** *This report provides a synthesis of current knowledge regarding Long COVID. Due to the evolving nature of research, recommendations are subject to change. Clinicians should use their professional judgment in the context of individual patient circumstances.*

## 1. Understanding Long COVID

Long COVID, also known as post-COVID-19 condition, refers to a wide range of health problems persisting or developing after a COVID-19 infection. Symptoms typically start within three months of the initial infection and last for at least two months and can affect a person's ability to perform daily activities [6, 2, 8]. Global estimates indicate that approximately 6% of individuals experience Long COVID [2]. Each subsequent COVID-19 infection incrementally increases the risk of developing Long COVID [2, 3].

**Action:** Prioritize prevention! The WHO emphasizes that risk reduction through preventative measures, such as vaccination, masking, personal hygiene, and ventilation, remains crucial [2].

## 2. Recognizing the Symptoms

Over 200 symptoms have been reported in Long COVID, affecting various body systems [7]. Common categories include:

*   **Neurological:** Brain fog, headaches, dizziness, sleep disturbances, fatigue [7, 8].
*   **Cardiovascular:** Palpitations, chest pain, exercise intolerance [4].
*   **Respiratory:** Shortness of breath, cough [7].
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Joint pain, muscle aches [7].

Recent research also indicates a link between Long COVID and eye health, with studies finding a decrease in blood flow in the smallest blood vessels in the deeper layers of the retina [17].

**Action:** Encourage patients to meticulously track their symptoms, noting severity and triggers. Tools like symptom-tracking apps (Bearable, Visible) or a simple journal can be invaluable.

## 3. Diagnosis

There is no single test for Long COVID [3, 4, 6]. Diagnosis relies on a patient's medical history, symptoms, and physical examination to rule out other conditions [3, 4]. Routine tests, including blood tests, chest X-rays, and ECGs, are essential to exclude other underlying health issues [4, 6]. Biomarker research is ongoing but not yet ready for clinical use.

**Action:** Conduct thorough evaluations to rule out other potential causes and tailor management to the patient's specific symptom profile.

## 4. Treatment Strategies

Treatment focuses on managing individual symptoms [2, 4]. No medications are currently FDA-approved *specifically* for Long COVID; treatments are used "off-label." Emerging therapies being explored include:

*   **Low-dose Naltrexone (LDN):** Being investigated in early-stage studies [2]. Larger, placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy.
*   **SSRIs:** Being explored to manage anxiety and depression, which are common comorbidities [2].
*   **Modafinil:** Being studied for managing fatigue and brain fog [2].

Researchers are also investigating whether anti-viral drugs could provide an effective treatment for Long COVID [11, 19]. Vanderbilt University Medical Center is conducting a trial to examine the effect of immunomodulation with baricitinib on Long COVID [13].

**Important Considerations:** Off-label use necessitates a thorough discussion between clinicians and patients about the limited evidence base, potential benefits, risks, and the experimental nature of these treatments. Patients should be fully informed that these are not FDA-approved *specifically* for Long COVID, and research is ongoing to determine their effectiveness.

**Action:** Discuss the potential benefits and risks of off-label treatments. Prioritize symptom management, pacing strategies, and rehabilitation services.

## 5. Self-Management & Support

Pacing is critical to avoid post-exertional malaise [2]. Connecting patients with Long COVID support groups and advocating for workplace accommodations are also vital [5, 9, 12, 18, 20].

**Action:** Educate patients on energy conservation techniques: plan rest breaks, prioritize tasks, and modify activities. Refer patients to support groups and resources like the Long COVID Justice support group and the Body Politic COVID-19 Support Group [5, 9, 12, 18].

## 6. Staying Informed

Higher BMI and limited access to healthcare may increase the risk of Long COVID in children [21]. Social and environmental factors, including access to healthcare, can also influence the development of Long COVID symptoms [21].

**Action:** Stay updated on research from reputable sources such as the CDC, WHO, patient advocacy websites (Body Politic, Patient-Led Research Collaborative), and research foundations [1]. Adjust treatment plans as new findings emerge. The NIH's RECOVER Initiative provides updated research findings [16, 21].

## 7. Prevention is Key

Vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe illness and may lower the likelihood of developing Long COVID [3, 22]. The ECDC reported that COVID-19 vaccination reduced the risk of developing Long COVID by approximately 27% in adults fully vaccinated before infection [22].

**Action:** Urge patients to stay up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccinations and consistently practice preventative measures.
