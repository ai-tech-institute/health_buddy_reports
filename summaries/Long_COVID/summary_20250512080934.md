### Long COVID: What You Need to Know (Updated May 12, 2025)

**Disclaimer:** *This summary offers current information and management tips based on the latest Long COVID research for patients and caregivers. It's for informational purposes only, not medical advice. Always consult your healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.*

**In a Nutshell:** Long COVID, or post-COVID condition (PCC), can affect many parts of your body, with symptoms lasting three months or more after a COVID-19 infection. There's no single cure, but managing symptoms and getting support can make a big difference. Focus on what bothers you most, pace yourself, prioritize sleep and mental health, and work with a healthcare team. Watch out for unproven treatments and stick to what's proven to work.

**What to Do Right Now:**

*   **Track Your Symptoms:** Keep a detailed journal of your symptoms to share with your doctor. Note the type, severity, timing, duration, and what makes it better or worse.
*   **Find a Long COVID Specialist:** Seek out doctors experienced in Long COVID, such as neurologists, cardiologists, or rheumatologists. Look for a Long COVID clinic if there's one near you.
*   **Stay Vaccinated:** Keep up with your COVID-19 vaccines to lower your risk of getting Long COVID.

**Understanding Diagnosis:**

*   Diagnosis comes from your medical history, symptoms, and a check-up. You don't need a positive COVID-19 test.
*   Your doctor may order tests to rule out other issues or check how your organs are working. These might include lung function tests, heart scans, or tilt table tests.

**Key Action: Discuss necessary tests with your doctor or a Long COVID specialist.**

**Risk Factors to Keep in Mind:**

*   Severe initial COVID-19 infection, existing health issues, and repeated infections can raise your risk.
*   Vaccination helps reduce the risk of severe illness and Long COVID.

**What's Happening in Research:**

*   Scientists are looking into whether the virus sticks around or if immune system problems cause Long COVID.
*   Some potential blood markers are being studied, but aren't ready for use in clinics. The role of microclots is also being investigated.

**Key Action: Stay informed, but trust your healthcare providers, and be careful of unproven treatments.**

**Managing Your Symptoms:**

*   Treatment is tailored to your specific symptoms, like fatigue, brain fog, pain, and shortness of breath.
*   **Pacing:** Balance activity and rest to avoid making your symptoms worse.
*   Get enough sleep and take care of your mental health.
*   Manage any dysautonomia or POTS symptoms.

**Examples of Strategies:**

*   *Brain Fog:* Use calendars, break down tasks, and reduce distractions.
*   *Pain:* Try physical therapy, gentle stretching, or hot/cold packs.
*   *Shortness of Breath:* Do breathing exercises.
*   *Dysautonomia/POTS:* Stay hydrated, increase salt intake (with guidance), do specific exercises, and consider medication.

**Rehabilitation Options:**

*   **Physical Therapy:** Helps with deconditioning and fatigue.
*   **Occupational Therapy:** Helps manage daily activities and conserve energy.
*   **Speech Therapy:** Helps with brain fog and swallowing or voice problems.

**Key Action: Participate in therapy as needed to tackle specific challenges.**

**Investigational Treatments:**

*   Clinical trials are testing new treatments. Participation is voluntary and requires your consent.
*   Categories of treatments being researched include monoclonal antibodies, antiviral medications, and drugs that modulate the immune response.

**Caution:** Some clinics offer unproven therapies like apheresis or ozone therapy.

**Key Actions:**

*   Consider joining a clinical trial to access new treatments. Check eligibility carefully and discuss potential side effects with your doctor. The NIH's RECOVER initiative is also studying treatments.
*   Avoid unproven and potentially harmful therapies.

**Living Well and Finding Support:**

*   A team of specialists can be helpful.
*   Explore workplace accommodations like remote work.
*   Connect with Long COVID support groups. Organizations like the Patient-Led Research Collaborative and Survivor Corps offer support.

**Key Actions:**

*   Build a healthcare team to meet your needs.
*   Advocate for workplace accommodations.
*   Join support groups to connect with others.

**Remember: Your symptoms are real. Advocate for your health and get the support you need.**
