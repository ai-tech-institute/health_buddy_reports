# Research Summary for Multiple Sclerosis

## Final Refined Summary

## Key Updates in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - April 2025

**Disclaimer:** This report provides a summary of recent developments in MS. Consult with your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.

This report delivers essential updates for individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and their caregivers, emphasizing actionable strategies to enhance care and quality of life.

### 1. Earlier and More Accurate Diagnosis

*   **Updated McDonald Criteria (Expected Late 2025/Early 2026):** Expect updates to the McDonald Criteria, the standard for MS diagnosis, which should allow for earlier and clearer diagnoses. These updates will incorporate advanced imaging biomarkers like the central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and CSF biomarkers. An updated criteria should lead to earlier treatment and help rule out similar conditions, potentially improving long-term outcomes.
    *   **Action Item:** In late 2025 or early 2026, ask your neurologist about the adoption of the updated McDonald Criteria and discuss how they apply to your specific situation.
*   **Central Vein Sign (CVS) on MRI:** CVS aids in distinguishing MS lesions from other conditions, increasing diagnostic confidence.
*   **Paramagnetic Rim Lesions:** These lesions indicate ongoing inflammation, vital for tracking MS activity and guiding treatment decisions, as well as predicting disease progression.

### 2. New and Emerging Treatments

*   **Tolebrutinib (Potential Approval Expected September 2025):** Tolebrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, is currently under FDA review, with a focus on non-relapsing secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS).
    *   **Action Item:** After the FDA's decision, discuss with your neurologist if Tolebrutinib is a suitable option for you, particularly if you have nrSPMS. Be sure to discuss potential side effects such as infections and liver enzyme elevations.
*   **BTK Inhibitors (Fenebrutinib):** Fenebrutinib is in Phase 3 trials for relapsing MS and progressive MS, with results expected by the end of 2025.
    *   **Important Note:** Fenebrutinib is still experimental. If interested, explore clinical trial options with your neurologist.
*   **Remyelination Therapies:** Focus on repairing damaged myelin. While still experimental, this area holds promise.
*   **CAR T-cell Therapy:** This highly specialized approach is reserved for severe progressive MS cases where other treatments have failed. It carries significant risks and is not a routine treatment.
*   **Stem Cell Therapy (MSC):** This remains investigational. Exercise caution regarding clinics offering stem cell treatments outside registered clinical trials due to unproven safety and effectiveness, as well as potential risks and costs.

### 3. Personalized Care and Monitoring

*   **Personalized Treatment:** MS treatment is increasingly tailored, considering MS type, MRI results, lifestyle, and other health conditions.
*   **Remote Monitoring:** Utilizes wearable sensors (tracking activity levels, sleep, or gait) or apps (for symptom and medication logging) to monitor symptoms and share data with your doctor. This allows for continuous tracking of MS progression and treatment effectiveness.
    *   **Action Item:** Inquire with your neurologist about remote monitoring options and discuss your individual needs and preferences.

### 4. Understanding Progression and Risk Factors

*   **Infectious Mononucleosis:** Linked to a higher risk of developing MS. Research suggests the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), which causes infectious mononucleosis, may trigger MS in some individuals.
*   **Vitamin D:** Essential for immune function and bone health. Low levels may correlate with increased MS risk and disease activity. Maintaining adequate Vitamin D levels is recommended.
    *   **Action Item:** Ask your doctor about checking your Vitamin D levels and discuss your specific needs.
*   **Menopause:** MS symptoms may worsen during menopause due to hormonal changes, particularly decreased estrogen.
    *   **Action Item:** If experiencing menopause and changes in MS symptoms, discuss symptom management and potential hormonal therapies with your doctor.
*   **Smoking and Obesity:** These are linked to faster MS progression.
    *   **Action Item:** Consult your doctor about resources for quitting smoking and managing weight.

### 5. Managing Symptoms and Enhancing Life Quality

*   **Lifestyle Changes:** Regular exercise, stress management, and sufficient sleep are crucial.
    *   **Action Item:** Seek personalized plans from therapists. Effective stress management techniques include mindfulness, meditation, yoga, and hobbies.
*   **Symptomatic Treatments:** These alleviate symptoms but don't alter the course of MS. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) target the disease itself.
*   **Fatigue and Mood:** Addressing depression can significantly reduce fatigue.
    *   **Action Item:** Discuss persistent fatigue with your doctor to screen for depression and explore treatment options.
*   **Diet:** A balanced, anti-inflammatory diet is recommended.
    *   **Action Item:** Seek guidance from a registered dietitian.
*   **Exercise:** Regular physical activity is crucial.
    *   **Action Item:** Develop personalized exercise plans with a physical therapist.
*   **COVID-19:** Research indicates that hospitalization for COVID-19 is linked to an increased risk of later developing MS [^1]. **Therefore, vaccination against COVID-19 is strongly recommended for individuals with MS and those at risk, as a crucial step in protecting their health.** Consult the CDC website [^2] for the latest vaccine recommendations.

### 6. Support and Resources

*   **MSAA and NMSS:** Offer extensive resources, support programs, and advocacy. [MSAA Website](https://mymsaa.org/), [NMSS Website](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/)
*   **MS Awareness Month:** Observed in March in the US, MS Awareness Month is a critical time to raise awareness, educate the community, and advocate for people with MS. This year from April 28 - May 4, a campaign is running. Get involved by sharing information and participating in events. #MSConversations.
*   **MSAA's 2025 MS Awareness Month Campaign:** "Empowered from the Start with MSAA".
