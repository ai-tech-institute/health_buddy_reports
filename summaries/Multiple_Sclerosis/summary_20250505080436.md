# Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Key Updates for Patient Care (2025)

**Disclaimer:** This information is for general knowledge only and does not substitute professional medical advice. Always consult with your healthcare provider for personalized guidance.

## 1. Faster Diagnosis: Get Answers Sooner

**What's New:** The McDonald Criteria for diagnosing MS have been updated to include new markers like serum Neurofilament Light chain (sNfL) and spinal fluid analysis (kappa free light chains and oligoclonal bands). These markers help detect MS earlier, especially when standard tests are unclear. Advanced MRI techniques, such as Central Vein Sign and Paramagnetic Rim Lesions, can also help distinguish MS from other conditions.

**Actionable Insight:** If you think you might have MS, ask your neurologist about these advanced diagnostic methods. Earlier diagnosis can lead to quicker treatment and better outcomes.

## 2. Treatment Breakthroughs: New Options

**Ublituximab (BriumviÂ®):** This intravenous treatment, approved in the US and Europe for relapsing MS, targets CD20 B-cells. It's given as an infusion every six months after the initial doses. Watch out for potential side effects like fever, chills, headache, nausea, infusion reactions, and infections. Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date before starting.

**BTK Inhibitors (Clinical Trials):** Oral medications like tolebrutinib, evobrutinib, fenebrutinib, and remibrutinib are being studied for progressive and relapsing MS. They target B-cells and myeloid cells, which could reduce inflammation and slow MS progression. Trial side effects can include elevated liver enzymes, infections, and headaches.

**Actionable Insight:** If you're interested in new treatments, ask your neurologist about BTK inhibitor clinical trials. You can find trials at ClinicalTrials.gov or at MS centers.

**Remyelination Therapies (Research):** Scientists are looking for ways to repair the myelin sheath, which protects nerve fibers. This involves encouraging the growth of myelin-producing cells (oligodendrocytes) or blocking substances that prevent remyelination. Successful therapies could restore nerve function and slow MS progression.

**CAR-T Cell Therapy (Severe Cases in Trials):** This aggressive immune reset is reserved for severe, treatment-resistant MS and is only available in clinical trials. It requires pre-treatment (chemotherapy) and hospitalization, and it carries risks like severe infections, cytokine release syndrome, and neurological events.

## 3. Proactive Monitoring: Staying Ahead

**Personalized Fatigue Management:** Keep track of what triggers your fatigue and work with your healthcare team to create a personalized plan that includes energy-saving techniques, exercise, and sleep strategies. The National MS Society provides resources for managing fatigue.

**Cognitive Monitoring:** If you're concerned about cognitive changes, talk to your neurologist. Early cognitive screening and support can help manage symptoms.

**Regular Health Checks:** Blood tests (CBC, LFTs, Kidney Function, Vitamin D) monitor treatment effectiveness, rule out other conditions, and detect medication side effects. Regular MRI scans track disease activity and brain changes. Managing overall health (blood pressure, cholesterol) is also important.

**Actionable Insight:** Review all monitoring results with your neurologist to make sure your treatment plan is the best it can be and to maintain your overall health.

## 4. Lifestyle Strategies: Enhancing Well-Being

**Healthy Living:** Exercise and quitting smoking can improve long-term outcomes. Manage fatigue and heat sensitivity, and prioritize your mental health.

**Good Habits:** Eat a balanced diet, stay active with low-impact exercises, and manage stress.

**Home Safety:** Make changes to your home to prevent falls.

**Seasonal Awareness:** Be prepared for changes in symptoms due to extreme weather.

**Actionable Insight:** Adapt your lifestyle and home for safety and comfort. Get professional help for depression, anxiety, or cognitive changes.

## 5. Building Your Support Network: You're Not Alone

**MS Awareness:** Patient organizations host events and offer resources. MS Awareness Month is in March.

**Find Support:** Connect with support groups for emotional support and information. The Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) offers various support programs.

**AI Caregiving Expert:** The Accelerated Cure Project offers a 24/7 AI resource for care partners.

**Actionable Insight:** Explore available support services and understand insurance coverage for caregiver support and home modifications.

**Key Points:** MS treatment should be personalized and decided together with your healthcare team. Early action is essential. Mental health is a core part of managing MS.
